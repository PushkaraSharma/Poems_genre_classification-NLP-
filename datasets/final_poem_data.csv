0,Why Is We Americans,"We is gator teeth hanging from the rear-
view mirror as sickle cells suckle at Big
Momma’s teats. We is dragonfly
choppers hovering above Walden Pond.
We is spinal cords shedding like the skin
of a cottonmouth. We is Psalm 23 and
the Pastor’s chattering chicklets. We is
a good problem to have. We is throats
constricting and the grape juice
of Jesus. We is Roach and Mingus in
Birdland. We is body electric, eyes
watering with moonshine, glossy lips
sticky with lard. We is half brothers in
headlock, arm-wrestling in the dirt.

have a problem? We is the backstory
of myth. We is sitting horse and crazy
bull. We is brown paper bags and
gurgled belches. We is hooded ghosts
and holy shadows roaming Mississippi
goddamned. We is downbeats and
syncopation’s cousin. We is mouths
washed out with the blood of the lamb.
We is witch-hazel-coated backs sucking
on peppermint wrappers. We is the
spiked antennas of a triangle face
praying mantis. We is barefoot
tongue-tied hogs with slit throats and
twitching bellies. We is sun tea and
brewed bitches. We is the crying
pussies that stand down when told to
man up. We is Radio Raheem and Zoot
Suit Malcolm. We is spit-slick low cuts
and fades. We is scrappy black-masked
coons and turkey-necked bullfrogs. We
is the pits of arms at stake, the clouds
frothing at the mouth. We is swimmers
naked, private parts allegedly fondled
by Whitman beneath the water. We is
late lurkers and castrated tree limbs
on the Sunday before last. We is red-
veined pupils and piss-stained knickers,
slack-jawed and slumped in the
bathroom doorway. We is whiplash
and backhanded ways of settling grief.
We is clubbin’ woolly mammoths
upside the head, jammin’ fingers in
Darwin’s white beard. We is comin’

bowlegged, laughin’ our heads off.
We is lassoed cowboys swingin’ in

1,Psalm,"I amuse myself with my country.
     I glimpse its future approaching on the eyelashes of an ostrich, I toy with its history and its days, I strike it with stones and thunderbolts. I extinguish its lamps and light its windows, and at the other end of day I inaugurate its history.

I am a stranger to all of you. I am from the other end. I live in a country of my own, inflating the sky to see its ashes, and in sleeping and waking I open a bud to live within.

Something must be born, so I bore caverns in my skin for lightning and build nests. I must pass like thunder into lips as sad as straw, between stone and autumn, between pore and epidermis, between thigh and thigh.
      And so I sing: “Form worthy of our demise—advance.”
     And so I shout and sing: “Who will give us the maternity of the cosmos, who will nourish us with mines?”

I advance toward my self, toward ruins. The silence of calamity takes me—I’m too short to gird the earth like a rope, I’m not sharp enough to pierce the face of history and plunge in.

You want me to be like you. You boil me in the cauldron of your prayers; you mix me with the broth of armies and the pepper of tyrants, then pitch me like a tent for the wali and hoist my skull like a flag.
     (My death,
     Nevertheless I run toward you, I rush rush rush to you.)

You live like flagstones, and lamentation is your air. You announce the hedgehog’s abode and sleep on the scarab’s censers—your children are immolations.

A distance as great as a mirage divides us.

I rouse hyenas in you, I rouse the gods. I sow sedition in you and suckle fever, then teach you to journey without a guide. I am a pole for your latitudes and a walking springtime. I am a convulsion in your throats, a hemorrhage in your words.


You advance like leprosy toward me, and I am the one bound to your dirt. Yet nothing unites us, everything divides us—so let me burn alone, let me pass through you like a spear of light.
     I cannot live with you, I cannot live without you. You are an undulation in my senses, and I cannot escape you. Even so, cry out, “The sea, the sea!” Even so, hang the beads of the sun on your thresholds.

Open my memory and study my face beneath its words, learn my alphabet. When you see foam weaving my flesh and stone flowing in my blood, you will see me.
      I am closed like a tree trunk, present and ungraspable like air. Thus I cannot surrender to you.

I was born in the sockets of lilacs, I grew in the orbits of lightning, I live with light and grass. I storm and I clear up, I shine and cloud over, I rain and snow—the hours are my language, and my country is day.

The people are sleeping, but if they die they’ll awaken, or so it was said. You are all sleeping, but if you awaken you’ll die, or so it shall be said.
     You are dirt on my windowpanes, and I must remove you. I am the coming morning and the map that draws itself.

Nevertheless, there’s a fever in my bowels that keeps vigil over you.
     Nevertheless, I await you,
     In the shell of night by the sea, in the roaring of the depths, in the holes in the robe of the sky, in the jujubes and acacias, in the pines and cedars, in the hearts of the waves, in the salt,
      I await you.

the sweat on an upper lip, the backing swell and ache

of baqalah-bought dates.

Every time they leave and come back
alive.

Birthmarks shaped like border disputes.
Black sand. Shah Rukh’s dimples, like bullets

4,"Brother as Younger Self, Humming","The streets of Shobra are still traced
with music from years ago—
children ripping
the clothes off lines,
pins scattering in a rounded clatter
of sharp-throated wooden notes.
It might have been a merging
of Mohamed Fouad
and Mohamed Mohy
or Mohamed Fawzi,
and my brother (also a Mohamed)
is sitting in the shimmering corner
of our grandma’s balcony with one leg up.
He wants to finish this one song
because it has his favorite parts,
which he has rewound a few times now,
and Mahmoud is downstairs again
yelling, holding a peeling board game
they taped together, and my brother’s eyes glint
over to the chorus, remembering how Mahmoud
once told him how his father comes home
only once a month, and he feels bad
he is taking so long to go downstairs
but this would be the last time
he rewinds the song, Mahmoud, wallahi,
he yells, the cassette player’s volume
on high but not loud enough
to drown out the street-market prices,
the chatter of bent men
at the coffeehouse, their fingers caterpillar-like
through the mugs, blowing
on clouded tea,
but the music is just enough
to shroud it all in the blur
of a filmy fog that Mahmoud can hear
and he can’t help but remember
how sometimes at night,
if he closes his eyes hard enough,
he hears the din of keys
against the door,
the whistling of a man
nearly always caught
in the middle

5,Bel Canto,"The opera
In her head

Runs with no interval,
A lot of people singing tunelessly

About the same things.
An overheard

Comment like
A rotting peach.

The overzealous
Cockatoo of her impatience,

Flap flap. The slab
Of blue behind her

6,The Thing Written,"The thing written is a sexual thing,
may bite, tell a truth some have died for,
even the most casual initialing
is a touch of love and what love goes for.
A sometime thing, it smiles or has an ugly grin,
on the page or wall may be holy and a sin.
Writing wants, must have, must know,
is flesh, blood, and bone,
proof we are not made to be alone.
Beneath a dove and rainbow
some bank their fire,
wrap their erogenous zones in barbed wire.

Writing may dance in ink flamenco,
kneel before the cross, right
wrongs, fall in love at first sight,
honor the naked languages it holds tight,
kidnap, suck or be sucked for hire,
may look and look or sneak a look,
it has eyes, can read, is remarkable.
From the tower of sexual babble,
when dreams were the beginning of writing,
the angel of dreams descended, stair by stair,
the stone watchtower became the first stone book.

Writing never speaks word, may ache to talk,
and yet each letter of any alphabet
is a fragment of desire,
like half and quarter notes on a staff, or a hawk,
may swoop down, fly higher and higher
to catch a word, and then another word.
The sexual thing may be all love or malice,
eunuchs writing in the Forbidden Palace
where poets dressed in rags, or silk and lace.
The thing written touches, kisses, cuddles,

may be democratic, autocratic, medieval
in the 21st century, feudal, imperial, animal,
sexually digital, a Serf, a King, a Queen,
la chose écrite est une chose sexuelle.
I had a woman beautiful as the letter   l.
There is the passion of letters, each may mean
another thing, be defaced, after a while.
Writing leans forward,
there is a certain optimism in the written word,
a sexual sunrise that is not daybreak.
Words, words, a carnival of wordplay
on St. Nobody’s Day.
Reader, look, there is an S, a snake
on the cross of the letter T.
The letter of love is still the open-legged V.

7,Ode to the Belt Sander & This Cocobolo Sapwood,"The belt kicks on with a whir & the whir
licks the end grain of the offcut with a hint

of  hesitation. A small wind of ochre dust
sweeps off the belt before the belt comes back

to where it was. The whole room swells
with the scent of cinnamon & desire.

How imprecise the smell of desire.

The wood takes on a sheen, a gloss
the grain can live behind without worry

of  being forgotten. A single knot blinks
out of the small block and becomes

the eye of a hummingbird, its beak
bending around the edge of the wood,

its small song captured in the annular rings.
To think, this block was tossed in

could have been lost. Or burned.",Art and Science

11,The Gargantuan Muffin Beauty Contest,"We were at the Edison Hotel on West 47th Street
for the annual muffin beauty contest —
I can’t tell you how pumped up we were.
Times Square was having another psychotic judder.
The bellhop was all thumbs up: Sir, have a nice day
and get one gratis. All those avenues of doors
and the Hispanic chambermaid who couldn’t speak English.
Spider-Man was doing all that Spider-Man shit
just to get a bird’s eye view. Donna Summer
was almost dead and we were barely into spring.
I want to dance to “Love to Love You Baby,” I want to groan.
I’ve never seen so many high-quality muffins.
If  I wasn’t a religious man, and maybe I wasn’t
I would have said the muffins were walking on water:
I’ve never felt so half-and-half. Have you read the Bible?
The bellhop said: You ain’t seen muffin yet.
They were drifting in from Queens, Brooklyn, Harlem,
The Bronx, Manhattan muffins too and that weird
cute coke-faced muffin who’d taken the subway
from Coney Island. If only I were a betting man,
but hey I am a betting man, it’s Coney Island every time.
Lou Reed isn’t getting any younger. Zappa said,
Girl you thought he was a man but he was a muffin,
he hung around till you found he didn’t know nuthin’.
In the lobby Nina Simone was singing, I Loves You Muffin
and in the restroom they piped in “Mack the Knife”:
Hey Suky Tawdry, Jenny Diver, Polly Peachum
and old Miss Lulu Brown. Muffin The Romance
was the biggest show in town. We were hurtling back
to the 1970s and sometimes the 1970s are almost
as good as the 1930s. I want my muffins to be ahistorical:
shit just to say ahistorical makes me joyful.
I saw Leonard Cohen crooning with a couple
of octogenarian muffins and I’m telling you now
the lobby was pleasantly disturbing. You may find
yourself   behind the wheel of a large automobile.
You may find yourself  in another part of  the world.
You may find yourself  at the gargantuan muffin beauty contest
and you may ask yourself, Well, how did I get here?
Times Square was having another psychotic judder.
Love is in the air, it’s in the whisper of the trees.
This is not America, this is the cover version:
sun, sex, sin, divine intervention, death and destruction,
welcome to The Sodom and Gomorrah Show.
All those white muffins trying to be black muffins!
Give us our daily muffin, save us from temptation.

14,A Winding Sheet for Summer,"1

I wanted out of the past so I ate the air,
     it took me further into air.
It cut me, an iridescent chord
     of geometric light.
I breathed deep, it lit me up, it was good.
All these years, lightning, rain, the sky,
     its little daisies.
Memento mori and lux.


  2

And you can’t blame me.
This daisy-feeling.
I was a poet with a death-style of my own
     waking.
I occupy the rest of it.
A blue-green leaving feeling.
To no longer belong to a body sometimes
     open to air.
In rain, in early morning rain.


  3

Today was the day of the amphitheater in mind.
The day of a dreaming speech where the light is dope
     and that’s all you can say.
When a feeling degrades and evolves into thought like
     2 a.m. dilated, revealed a star.
It will say this long agony is great being awake.
It is being lovely now.


  4

All the stars are here that belonged to whatever
     was speaking.
I built my life out of what was left of me.
Sky and its procedures.
A romanticism of clouds, trees, pale crenellations,
     and poetry.
A musical joybang.
Touching everything.


  5

When the words come back their fictions remain.
Thunderheads and rain, lexical waters raking gutters,
     carving a world.
The stylus will live in the flash.
A daring light from pewter to whatever.
Now discrete observations produce undramatic sound,
     like I am a bubble,
make me the sea. O, make me the sea.


  6

For a long time the names of things and things unnamed.
For a long time hawks and their chicks, fox and their cubs,
     mice and their mice.
For a long time bunnies and boojum, and a name
     for every bird in me.
I am native to feathers — their netherside.

The sun was a goldish wave taped to a book.
A wavy diagram in a fusty book.
Foxed old wave.
A soft electro-fuzz enters the head.
A soft fuzzy opiate lightness.
What could be the message in this
     pointillist masquerade.
What use memory.

I came from a different world.
I will die in it.
Someone saw it, I love them for seeing it.
I love seeing it with them.
Love watching it die in me.
It wasn’t behind or beside me.
Finding it wasn’t it.
Being it was everything.
That was the thing I thought as I fell.


  9

I am that thing in morning, whatever motors in the skull,
     something is claimed.
Sudden rain keeps it real.
Rooftops from the window look stunned.
     Cleansed.
Looking out over the day, the pale performing day.
I always consult the air before composing air.

And what have you been given, the blue nothing asks,
     who are you under clanging brass?
Who are you, Saturday; sing to me.
See the crows thread summerismus.
Afternoon shade mirrors an issuelessness.
A perfection of beetle slowly treading summer’s blade.
The leaves broadcast color.
I was born in summer, my conqueror,
     breaking into wisteria.

The sun was a golden rag nailed to a ladder.
And here the marigolds grow down to the banks.
The mayflies drowse above water.
How then the dazzling surface and its dictions
     under piled clouds,
and clouds sitting there by place and sound.
One thing. This thing and sound glitters.
Indicative transitive particular battles the void.
All afternoon a green-gold silent light
     on the spotted grass, sprung.

I know it’s summer even if I can’t decipher the call.
I believe in the birds haunting me. I held on.
I’m full of bluster but also full of vision.
I’m not ready to put the book down.
To stop singing bright spots thrilling the quicksilver
     over my torrent.
I make sounds, forget to die. I call it living,
     this inhuman conch in the ear.
A pewter sensation and wind.


  13

The sun remains a yellow sail tacked to the sky.

To the race of dolls and the progeny of rags.

I saw trees seducing me,
I saw rooms among their branches,
Beds and windows resisting me,

Gleaming behind them.

My waves were wind and pelicans.

Our city fled,
And refusal is a crushed pearl
Whose powder anchors my ships,
And refusal is a woodcutter living
On my face—it gathers me and sets me on fire—
And refusal is the distance that disperses me.
I see my blood and I see my death
Beyond my blood:
It speaks to me and pursues me.

Our city fled,
And I saw how my shroud illumines me,
I saw ... If only death would grant me time.

20,Why I Am Not a Sculpture,"To be a statue               carved by Bernini
Lounging in a climate-controlled museum in Rome         is luxury
Like the luxury of a personal pan pizza            with unlimited free toppings
Or the luxurious feel of a premium eye pencil          used to draw bisons on the walls of a French cave
To be so white and glossy                   is unimaginable
Like how I imagine a plate of eggs painted by Velázquez           or the lid of a designer toilet cistern
In a European magazine                       (I could be European
And wear a dashingly arranged scarf          or sip weirdly-named liqueurs that taste like semen
In a Rococo palais)                but in the scheme of things
Where I am marble and still                  my wrist will be a marvel
Like the marvel of an isthmus           whose name can only be pronounced if you have a lisp
Or the marvelous sausage                that saved a man from the Inquisition in 1582
It is definitely marvelous                    to be as attenuated
As the casually extended leg of a greyhound                   reclining on its very own velvet settee
To be so thoroughbred                          is an accomplishment
Like the thoroughly flattened face of a Persian cat                   which always looks peevish
Or the extremely frivolous ceiling                   of a banqueting hall where royals are put to death
If it is admirable to be so luxurious                    then I will never be admired
The way a designer toilet cistern is admired               or a piece of elaborate pâtisserie
(Although I am not a statue                   I have often held my arms aloft
As when catching a carelessly thrown baby              or pointing at two meteors at the same time)
It is exhausting trying to be so inanimate               and desirable
If my arm breaks off  like the shell                of a freshly-filled cannoli
You will know why",Art and Science

The movie is better than the book
which is better than the experience
silver is better than gold (it doesn’t infect piercings)
a fake masterpiece is better than a real one because at least it’s affordable
permadeath in virtual warfare is better than actual death in actual warfare
imitation is better because it’s sincere
whereas innovation seeks to impress
and anyway is never what it says it is
the second time is better than the first, as you well know!
the remake is self-conscious and therefore more morally alert
this sentiment is better than the other times it has been expressed
because in the past it was expressed more forcefully and now it can relax
even thinking that Salinger meant David Copperfield the 1980s magician
who made real cars and buildings disappear
is better than knowing he meant Dickens
but only because others have thought this before you
and written about their mistake with winning modesty
or honesty or both
a cat hunting a bird is better now
because of cartoons
just as the cat that lives next door
is a better cat because it is not your cat anymore
a rhyme is better the more times it has been used
cliché is better than truth
truth is just something that hasn’t become a cliché yet
but inevitably will
(then you can put it in your pocket
and no one can put the truth in their pocket)
and any king or queen or president or prime minister
is better than all previous kings or queens or presidents or prime ministers
any poem is better than all the poems that precede it
that say essentially the same thing
which means new is better than old
but only if it looks or sounds or otherwise seems somehow old
being in a simulation is better than being in reality
watching the simulated stars set to ambient music created by a gifted recording artist
is better than watching real stars set to dismal sounds from real life
derivative beauty is better than any other kind
(here we are surrounded by all this derivative beauty—imagine!)
however the audience will still say “nah”
however many times you say
the cover version is better than the original
but the cover version is always better than the original
I know that the cover version is always better than the original
and the reason I know the cover version is always better than the original
is that I’ve never heard the original

the bastard
and why look up from your phone
at your desk at reception
when it seems you’re the only one the satire on the walls this month has seen
(it can’t cut both ways, can it?)
and nobody has ever penetrated the depths of the mercedes that waits
like a black moon
or a scoop of something poisoned
melting on the curb outside
ignored by wardens as if they can’t perceive the gleaming anomaly
so great is it
and you with your “I always had a good nose for it”
you with your aquiline sophistication and games of insolence
their verve dulling let’s be fair in these conditions
and your brochures
your spelling

If you want to know my wishes briefly Mark,
famous host, bright ornament, OK then, pronto—
I ask to be the master of a great rural cultivator
of the soil, a small tribe used to the easiness of dirt.
I do. And to worship the cold painted rocks at dawn
with an unfit “hello.” And later when the presents
are in stockings crowded by the chimney breast,
to remember the lead-haired fisherman I was then,
waiting a year for the prize of a red honey jar,
at a sagging table eating my eggs among ashes—
whoever does not love this does not love this life!
I hope that you live, and the city, amid duties.

I don’t wish to shave my head again

In general I hate discussing my poetry
so I always ask questions
there’s a kind of writer/artist though
and you meet them all the time now
who only talks about their “practice”
without anyone caring or asking
(it isn’t connected to success)
and shows no flicker of interest
in anything anyone else does
if the choice is between talking about me
when I don’t want to talk about me

Was anyone else ever here? Not a trace of a prior occupant. No candy wrapper. No smudge on the high-gloss sheen. Yet I marvel at the labor that must have gone into all those preparations: someone lifting the mattress, twice, as you must, and adding the final touches; smoothing away all traces of a final touch, filling the glass precisely, so the camber of water fits like a seal over the rim.

A radio on the nightstand. It lights up, and there’s the very voice in my mind, arguing with itself, trying to convince itself that it suffers. Why so many hypnotic cadences, so many rhetorical flourishes—anaphora, chiasmus, parataxis—such subtle case logic, Rogerian argument, appeals to so many arbiters: God, reason, justice, twilight?

Search from station to station, and the white noise in between. On fm, am, and shortwave, the same rapt monologue. That marshaling of precedent, scientific data, illustrations from the history of medicine, the Upanishads, the Vedas, the sutras and suras, the Sermon on the Mount. But what is suffering? Is it true that it requires my consent?

circling like bats

I’m afraid it’s not.)
It rained. I wrote
a pining song

refusing your offer

to stay with you
and your boyfriend

who spoke no French
while I
conducted vertiginous conversations

with a curator
at the Musée Gustave Moreau
pinning my hopes
on words like “Gautier” (Théophile)
“Mallarmé” and “Rimbaud”

of course),

even further with the help
of Google translate
in my letters to you

it wasn’t Baudelaire

maybe Marat,
and you, Charlotte Corday).
I liked the pining song,
in the end,

it’s Morrissey-esque, funny
but grim, slippery
and only incomplete
without (or with) you.

go again,

flat-footed
on my horizon

my itchy head, I

Red blood cells live some hundred days before they are worn out by their silent hustle—looping and looping, pounded through the heart’s chambered cathedral, rushing out to the farthest reaches of the body with the good news of oxygen, squeezing single file along capillaries, like anxious deer probing their tracks through the woods. Rushing, silent, looping the circuits of the body. Again, again, again. Load iron. Dump iron. Load dump squeeze hustle.

Red blood cells pushed through the capillaries that pushed through my retinas. They broke loose to run a green swarm in the corral of my eye. But that is history. Today cells still push through the capillaries fenced off by my calloused fingerprint. This one that I run over the Braille cell, the pattern of bumps.

A red blood cell is measured in microns. A solitary prison cell is measured in feet. Six feet by nine feet or less. I don’t know what the unit of measure is for how living in solitary changes a person. We know that living in a confined space, without access to the long view or landscape, changes the eye. The eye, for lack of practice, loses its ability to make out what lies in the distance. I don’t have a unit of measure for what this does to the heart.

A Braille cell is measured in spaces in a grid—two across by three down—that can be filled with a raised dot or bump. Different combinations of dots represent different letters, punctuation, symbols, shorthand.

The oldest cell I find in the dictionary is the monastic cell, a place for contemplation. From the concealed place where wine was stored. As in cellar. I find Braille contemplative. I touch my index finger to a bumpy piece of paper. My hand advances slowly left to right, the touch receptors in my finger triggered by the uneven contact of paper and skin. Messages run along nerves, finger-to-brain, brain-to-finger. Cognition sizzles. Mind notices this feels different than the pathway of sound in ear to auditory processing. Listening pulls me out into the world in an infinity of directions. Touching my reading educates me on my exact location in the world, feet in shoes, weight of foot on ground, weight of bones and flesh in chair.",Art and Science

She wakes up calling her name.
She wakes up knowing that she doesn’t want less.

From House of Cards she learned a new rule: “I love that
woman. I love her more than sharks love blood.”

Likely the tool with which Louis Braille blinded himself as a child in France. An accident in his father’s saddle-making shop in the early years of the nineteenth century. Braille later invented a system of raised dots as a means of reading and writing for the blind. We don’t know much. Whether he was in the shop with his father or snuck in alone. Whether it was damp and rainy or whether the sun shone and brought to life the floating dust that always hung in the workshop air. Maybe it was just a little poke in the eye. A small tool, a small slip of the hand, a small injury. How a little fumble ends in blindness. It was decades before general anesthetic or antiseptics. Perhaps the doctor they rushed him to believed in the value of “laudable pus” in a wound. I don’t want to picture it. As a child, playing in his father’s saddle-making shop, did Louis Braille already know the names of the parts of a saddle—cantle, pommel, stirrup, tree? Did he know the smell and feel of each grade of leather? Of all the tools—punch and pincers, gouge and groover, chisel and awl—he chose awl.

When patience stretches
Between the banks of our love and death.

To the tongue of strangled bells,
To stone approaching from afar,
To aridity and the arid land,
To time borne on a stretcher of ice,

When history burns in my garments,
When blue nails sprout in my book,
When I shout during the day,
Who are you? Who’s thrusting you
Into my notebooks,
Into my virgin earth?
In my notebooks, in my virgin earth,
I glimpse two eyes of dust
And hear someone say,
“I am the wound that grows
In your narrow history.”

I named you cloud,
Wound, dove of departure,
I named you quill and book.
And here I am, starting a dialogue
Between myself and the drowned tongue
On the isles of exodus,
On the archipelago of the ancient fall.
And here I am, teaching the dialogue
To the wind and palms—
Wound, dove of departure.

Had I a harbor, had I a vessel
In the land of dreams and mirrors,
Had I the remains
Of a city, had I a city
In the land of children and weeping,

Into a spear-like song
That pierces trees and stones and sky,
A song as supple as water,
Unruly and dazed, like conquest.

World adorned with dreams and yearning,
Rain down on our deserts,
Rain down, but shake us, palms of the wound,
And break two branches off for us
From the trees that love the silence of the wound,
From the trees with arched lashes and hands
That keep vigil over the wound.

World adorned with dreams and yearning,
World falling in my brow,
Drawn like the wound,
Come no closer—the wound is closer than you.
Don’t tempt me—the wound is more beautiful,
And the wound has passed by that enchantment
Cast by your eyes
In the last kingdoms,
Passed without leaving a sail to tempt it astray,
Without leaving it an island.

37,Woodcut,"The trouble with Jane Eyre
isn’t what I thought when I slammed shut the book
on those pictures trying to fly out at me
because I misunderstood, being too young

to read. When you’re unable to read a book
you can’t understand the illustrations either.
Those were my mother’s books, a green bound set
of that one and the book by her sister, Emily.

When you can’t understand the artwork
the face at the window is a monster.
It is only Cathy, though, in the book by Brontë’s sister,
calling for her lover. And the awful figure bending

over Jane’s bed with the candle, that monstrous
creature—well, there are flaws in the mind of Jane, too,
and the awful figure bending over her
might be the tormented wife of Rochester.

There’s a flaw in Jane’s mind, too,
looking down on the young French child
born to another tormented mother
whom Rochester says has inherited sin.

The young French child likes presents too much,
likes to dance and sing—and so what? She is love-starved,
this child who has supposedly inherited sin,
who will never get the approval of Mr. Rochester.

We lose track of the pretty child who likes to sing.
Jane goes away for a while to prove her purity.
Then, when the other wife dies, Mr. Rochester
will approve. Reader, I married him, she says,

after she has gone away for a while. He is blind
from the fire the crazy wife set. And then, miraculously,
her love asks if she is wearing a blue dress.
I believe she is pregnant, then, carrying a child

who will be a good child, miraculously.
Charlotte Brontë knew only part of the happy ending.
Perhaps he gets better and sees the blue dress.
We have to believe things turn out well,

while Charlotte, herself, had nine months of pleasure
and died. And so the book, which ends as if resolved,
asks us to believe things turn out well, the French girl gone,
Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out

mansion, because books then ended resolutely
and did not reflect how it is to have a calm life,
Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out

from the embers of her Oakland home. Bakhtin, as we know,
smoked his very best pages in prison. The poems of Radnóti were found by his widow in
his overcoat, in a mass grave. One scribbled until his last
conscious breath in an apartment in Waltham, brimmed over with hellish fury and
dysfunctional passion. One was imprisoned on a ship
in Valparaiso during the military coup, but lived with his “iron bad health” to carve a
poem 3.5 kilometers long in the Atacama Desert,
and another in the skies over Brooklyn; to cover thousands of pages with anguish and

its noise into the dark. Grows like bone,
    does hair, strengthens against stress, all our

bacon spit, grease. And he is starting to plait my wet hair,

          over my shoulders and asking me to guess the weight
of disaster. Absently, I count a kink from flu, a thickening

    Abacinate. Abscess. Abyss. Ab ovo. At Macondo, he reads

metaphorically, so it can sometimes seem now, though
the forest was real, as my life beside it was. I spent
much of my time listening to the sounds of random, un-
knowable things dropping or being dropped from, variously,
a middling height or a great one until, by winter, it was
just the snow falling, each time like a new, unnecessary
taxonomy or syntax for how to parse what’s plain, snow

others — in that part of the mind where mistakes and torn
wishes echo as in a room that’s been newly cathedraled,

itself that can still most surprise me about memory —
it’s more the time it takes, going away: a mouth opening
to say I love sex with you too it doesn’t mean I wanna stop
my life for it, for example; or just a voice, mouthless,
asking Since when does the indifference of the body’s
stance when we’re alone, unwatched, in late light, amount

to cruelty? For the metaphysical poets, the problem
with weeping for what’s been lost is that tears
wash out memory and, by extension, what we’d hoped
to remember. If I refuse, increasingly, to explain, isn’t
explanation, at the end of the day, what the sturdier
truths most resist? It’s been my experience that
tears are useless against all the rest of it that, if I
could, I’d forget. That I keep wanting to stay should
count at least for something. I’m not done with you yet.",Art and Science

Consider now the three, or is it four figures
in Alberto Valdés’s Untitled (ca. 1965).
They are wayward energy, moving right
to left (the right one more sensuous than the rest)
about to dive
into the deep-blue waiting — call it the unknown.
I’d like to be there when they meet that blue abyss
head on.
Will they keep their shape, I wonder,
or break up and rearrange themselves
into a brighter, more memorable pose

I’m really asking this:
When they run into the landscape of  blue,
will these figures lose their logic of  luster?
Will they lose their lucid argument of color,
their accumulated wealth of geometry?

Wire song on cold wind musing low, tension wang and resonance, the land and ghosts play along and now and then a sheep bleets, but it hardly makes a bar onto these wire songs ...
  Small spinifex spin
down from a spirit circle;
the writers cottage ...

  No ghosting to report on this tour but aplenty haunting of words, sentences prematurely entertained that have the capacity to poltergeist and a writer’s biting off; too much in a spell! To only want that wire song later to floss with, when civilized nights of too much consumer discount become morose, head aching to be left alone and everyone thinks you need to be alone when you only want to sing aloud and be heard in the ides of a full moon over pine trees and granite boulders, simple, wire song ...",Art and Science

Accommodate the action in your life
to wrest the deep perspective of the real
from cubic content realms of atmosphere
at play beyond the bank and shoal of time.

Then resonance begins, and all vibrates.
The syntax of position no more sculpts
this world of interpenetrative forms
than syntaxes of motion render grace.

Yet syntax is the caul on all our births;
and mothers claw the membrane from our eyes
to fret us into life, in losing theirs.
From there, each choice engraves a different choice.

The decades pass. One needle for one groove.
The canticles flare chaos from the spin.
The gyre to crackly zero stays the same.

We sliced the wave face, tumbling into light.

57,"Sheep, Golden Syrup, Elizabeth Bishop","Do not a civilization make. Do they? Cozy up to the fleece of a sheep, take the lid off Elizabeth Bishop’s head and get a spoon. Do not eat yet; do not swoon. There will be hours for that. First there is a long war march. Then there are other animals to press into the barn before the lightning storm comes to cook the grass and rinse it and make a mess. But this is all outside and you need never go there. Can you ride a tin? Yes, you can, says the child detective. The poet lies under the sheep, reading of Robert Menzies, his wife Pattie, and their pets. “We had a lovely weekend,” they tell reporters. Just months later their cat’s dead. Robert turns from the golden syrup, while deciding whether to use a knife or a spoon, the television on though it’s only 8 am. Elizabeth was reading her poetry aloud into a woolly microphone. She thought she saw the top of Robert’s head pass by the window.
  She was thinking of the story “Marmosets” she was translating, by Clarice Lispector. A spirit moved out of the shadows and found an unopened tin in the cupboard and threw it at the window, causing the monkeys on the verandah to flee from the glass. You can hear it on the recording at PennSound. A shearer found glass in a sheep’s fleece months later. “Lucky.” “Why lucky?” “Lucky it didn’t take your thumb off.” That was what Bishop heard about it. She wanted something to give to Clarice. Something in wool or a painting. She saw the earth tipping up, as if she was falling over while looking out the window, and she was traveling to Australia via a flying tin of golden syrup, where there were sheep all ready to cushion her, but it wasn’t necessary for she fell into the arms of the Prime Minister. “Tilted space age pastoral,” she thought, but “marmoset” was what she murmured up at him. He could hear his wife crying that their cat was dead. “It was bloody ASIO!” she bawled. Saying sorry, he dropped the unexpected visitor on the lawn and went to his wife’s aid. He spread one of the scones he’d baked earlier and made a fresh pot. “I don’t want any of that ASIO muck,” Pattie grizzled. Robert turned to Elizabeth to see if she could hear, ready to explain how upset his wife was. Elizabeth had found a curious black spread in the cupboard and was helping herself. “That’s not food,” baa’d the sheep detective. Lightning struck where they’d been sitting just minutes before. “Life is not flat, that’s for sure,” Elizabeth thought to herself, remembering the sheep in the window back home, and starting to write a poem. It would be about flying through the air, and strange food, and the floury arms of a patriarch.",Art and Science

her two daughters under an umbrella meant for one.
The younger daughter

this small family

in his lush, impressionistic style. Five years later, after visiting
Italy and studying
Piero della Francesca’s frescoes, he came back and finished the painting

on the left as if they were

granite to be sculpted. She carries a market basket filled

To approach old age, one needs a new, harsher style. Here, by the Liffey,

mothers push screaming
infants in strollers. Five teenagers in blue jeans and bright yellow or green raincoats

a long ten seconds.
Another boy shouts over his shoulder, “Get a room!” A pair

how the clouds pass,

avalanche of cumulus that hangs forever on the burnished

Well, you can have friends. She had never meant

she’s afraid of losing me to a foreigner, being unable to speak
to her future grandchildren. Thousands of miles away

Thrown by the white drugs of pain though pain
Was adrift on a glassy stream of green tide
Where images flickered and ran on

I didn’t write poetry for publication
In those days but to grab the attention
Of readers nearby who had been crushed by life
Who floated across the exercise yard like headaches

Smoking rag-cigarettes looking sideways
For the next punishment for a break or maybe distraction
Chips of memory kept rising to the surface
Of our minds to take another bite

I had no idea why poetry the squid caught me
It clung to my brain in the damaging climate
A creature in the alien element of air
Arising from centuries of survival

Thoughts must be inky and capable
Of working the bait with a black beak
For a quick kill and a metaphysical rise up through the abyss
Poetry in those days was a handmade lure

There were no fish or birds so I spun my lines
To the ones with heads spring-loaded with resentment
Their temper a red fleck twitching in an eye
While poems of the future waited in line to hear my number",Art and Science
96,There’s a Limbo Moon Above,"The best-known German goldsmith of the sixteenth century, Wenzel Jamnitzer, is also remembered for his study of the five platonic solids, Perspectives of Regular Bodies, in which he proposed that out of the same five bodies one can go on endlessly making all other bodies.

The five solids originate with Pythagoras, but are named after Plato, who paired four of the five solids with each of the four elements and the fifth with heaven to make up the difference: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), cube (earth), icosahedron (water), and dodecahedron (heaven).

The idea is that the universe is made up of a handful of shapes and out of these shapes other shapes are made.

In a letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Nobel Prize Committee, Chubby Checker claimed to have invented the dance that begat all other modern dances.

Speaking of himself in third person he wrote, “Chubby Checker changed everything. He gave movement to a music that never had this movement before. The styles changed. The nightclub scene is forever changed. Checker gave birth to aerobics.”

The song originally called “What a monotonous melody,” written in five minutes on a dare, begat “Limbo Rock” begat “Let’s Limbo Some More” begat “Mary Ann Limbo” begat “Limbo Rock/Do the Limbo Rock,” as “The Twist” begat “Let’s Twist Again” begat “Slow Twistin’” begat “Twist It Up” begat “The Twist (Yo, Twist!).”

Checker calls his dance “dancing apart to the beat,” not dancing separate from the beat, but two people dancing separate from one another.

“Limbo Rock” ends in a whistle.

Limbo, the dance, comes from Trinidad, where it was danced at wakes, but in reverse: the bar began at the lowest height and was raised to symbolize a rising from death into life.

Dante’s limbo is the best circle of Hell, all those unbaptized babies and old philosophers to snuggle up with at night.

“Mary Ann Limbo” starts with a whistle.

All day, all night, Mary Ann
Down by the sea side siftin’ sand
Even little children love Mary Ann
Down by the seaside siftin’ sand

97,Subject and Object,"On “Sueño No. 5: Botella del mar,” a photograph by Grete Stern (1950)
The woman sits clutching her knees
inside a short-necked bottle on a beach,
looks up smiling at a mouth above
all imagined itineraries.
We like to think she volunteered
to be lowered into the bottle.
On her own idea, even
her own craftiness, lured into being
enrobed with the thick glass that is the gray-blue
of a ukiyo-e sky of flying cranes
who breathe the steam
of that bluish gray ideation and
end of autumn, or a plume of smoke
from a train in the middle distance.

Swells of warm seawater push wet sand against
spun tips of seashells that sit on the warmed strand
like nobility on a plush settee.
The bottle’s bottom edge lists in the hot
sand, the heat of the morning sunlight penetrates
the bottle walls, and foam and breeze coax
a juddering creature from underneath.
From inside the woman argues with herself that
the horizon is another of the world’s ambitions.

Those ships slipped into bottles
with volition and self-responsibility,
acquiesce so marvelously,
like the glass fitting
so smoothly around her. She is a person
born to be put into this and admired as perfection
from the outside, which is how we love flowers

hanging herself like laundry over her own arm.

Nipple-colons introduce this scene of medieval war:

horses crowned with riders are leaving;
horses’ tails, like a clock’s hands, whip
flies of hours off their round thighs.

Time is an insect that leaves
its maggots to hatch on an open wound of a mammal.

There’s more face on these thighs than on all of the women’s bodies.

One, with an arrow aimed at her, hands on her bent
knees as if she wanted to ski into death like a scared

child, mocks the splendid horse tails with hair
so red, all of her blood must have gone into it.

They gave me the wrong repertoire list. How was I to know that high altitude affects clarinet reeds? I ran out of beta blockers. I forgot to bring a water bottle. I was worried that they’d hire that asshole who they don’t like because he threatened to blackball them at the union meeting. The acoustics were terrible. The second violinist used a new rosin and that threw her off, which unnerved me. My tinnitus roared the whole time. Robyn auditioned right before me. Just as I blew the first note, it dawned on me that Robyn might be sleeping with the conductor. Someone backstage slammed a door and I had to start all over again. The concertmaster doesn’t know a trumpet from a trombone, but since he’s powerful in a certain tiny corner of the music world everyone feels forced to curry favor with him. I forgot to eat. The audition committee talked the whole time. A clang in the heating system was near deafening. My carpal tunnel flared up. My neck twinges flared up. My arthritis flared up. I only got a few hours of sleep. I would have won the last competition, except that the concertmaster’s student was appointed with no audition, so I kept wondering if the same thing would happen again. I forgot I wasn’t playing the flute. I only got a few hours of sleep because Robyn and I were on the phone all night and decided to end our marriage. I really fucked up.",Art and Science

your voice is constant — “kill yourself, kill yourself, kill

nothing more than punched clay. Other times, you’re
a cinema in my skull, screening me mangled: one leg
auger-mauled, hand vice-crushed, eye pencil-blinded to life

on a page like Jaffee’s in the back of MAD; you fold it
over and now the rise is the wound from a wing cleaved

a drain. Yet with each step the unrelenting chorus of you

your gale, the melodies of friends whose works asphyxiate your
symphony, the lessons students teach about tipping your
plinths, the magic of  bringing nib to page and penning life
with urgency and patience, word by word, with abandon
and care. Even though I know it can never silence you, I love
this inky trick because it fills the blank before you can, marks
up your script, swallows you choking in a page-mutating

the dreamer is everyone in her dream. Yes,

an oasis city lit by multiple moons

indigenous genies served as surrogates
and guides, leading us through the gates

after painting. So entranced were we

élan of the gardens and towers, amiable
night birds and camels of the optically
implausible dimensions before our
eyes, that like the dazzled apostle

like a vegan interrogating a list of ingredients

how a Doberman could be dishonest,

to the door of a boarded-up summer bungalow
then top that double dose of pepperoni
by having even the most casual conversation
served with Denali-sized asides of organic skew.
Fact: the US has 95,000 miles of shoreline,

while all you smell is full-length fur coats
matted by a downpour in MacArthur Park and

reading obnubilating poems

needing to be present, who tailed me,
who mailed women years ago when he
was free with his attention,
a fixation that he felt attended him.

               Sometimes several times a week
then several times a day

to borrow books, go to the mailbox
at 3 a.m., for it was urgent that he send
a bride issue of Vogue, Bazaar,
(not Seventeen, but Glamour, but not Ms.)
from the Heartland where
(Don’t forget our wedding date!)
he bubble wrapped some trinkets, snapshots —
poses of his parakeet beside his own long head

               meeting at an angle in a steely mirror.
His wife, from her wheelchair,
had made their camera flash.
He tried to kill his wife
with a little hammer,
the D.A. calling said. The D.A. asks
who are his friends; he cannot name
or call a single one. Define what
friendship saves your isolation from.
Detained, he clarifies for me:
It was a little hammer.

115,The Doctrine of Photography,"The city where I grew up
was not a western city,
nor an eastern city.
It lay north of Bohemia, south
of Greenland, below sandstone Switzerland
in a river valley, green with fields.
It was the dump in the middle, the rump
of an exquisite gesture in stone —
a suite in Hotel “Old Europe.”

Stuck under layers of wallpaper,
newspapers from a world gone by:
reports of Zeppelin flights,
League of Nations conferences,
“Miscellaneous,” alongside adverts
for brassieres and ironing boards.
But the view to the river
was blocked with gray barracks.
And the southern wing,
and the northern wing,
broken like the Baroque Palace,
furnishings given for junk.
All of it somehow stranded:
the steamers and churches, the domes.
And not much life in the bar.

But then I found it one day
down on the banks, under rusty nails,
heaps of nuts and bolts
from machines long since dismantled,
factories expropriated, torn-down,
I found it amongst the bones,
unearthed by scavenging dogs,
ribs and vertebrae, splinters
of human and beast, so it seemed —
the key to the city.
And found a kind of peace.
And knew where I was,
and where I came from —

until I saw the photographs,
not the ones at home in the album,
but for sale on the street market stall.
Archive pictures, postcards
of street scenes, city views
from between the wars, moments
from a life gone by,
some still with the stamp
“original print, by hand.”

Past the housefronts, all still intact,
over the bridges, the broad terraces,
along the Königsufer, the banks
of the Elbe, people walking, all dead now,
but the youngest in their prams.
Mothers in dark coats and hats
were chained for all time
to this or that man with a briefcase.
On a traffic island, a boy
in lederhosen who would never age,
staring from the poster
for “Riquet Cocoa Chocolate.”
“Alsberg Ladies Wear, Wilsdruffer Straße:
the new bathing costume from Alsberg.”
And the beauty in silk stockings,
getting out of the tram, no. 11,
picked out by chance, and her too,
fixed in that spot forever.
All of them passersby in time —
the girl at the flower stall on Altmarkt,
the one by the striped awnings
on Prager Straße. At the station
the clock forever at half past ten.

A morning that lasts for eternity —
mostly in spring, in summer,
in a city that was not eastern,
nor western. Scarcely a photo
that ever showed it in deep snow.
The sign for Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten
stood by the entrance to the subway.
Soon an r was missing, an n, then an a.
Power cuts, petrol grew scarce,
people took to bikes again after Stalingrad.
Not long now and almost all of it
will be erased, a phantasmagoria
like the desert palace of Kubla Khan.
And your gaze leaped back and forth
looking for the place it all began.
 

Was it the high tide? The moment
that saw the sparkling twenties in.
People peering over the railings
at Brühl’s Terrace, dismayed
at the rising of the Elbe.
Like mourners at a wake
all clothed in black. An entire
people clothed in black, back then.
Though the worst was behind them:
four years of war in Europe, carnage.
All of them losers, people suddenly
with time on their hands, time to
gather in dark clumps. Only a girl
in a sailor suit, laughing and spitting
over the railing into the swollen,
mud-brown river, cold as the grave.

Or maybe the storm in the thirties,
that wrecks the funfair booths
at the Vogelwiese fairground.
Visitors watch the chaos in despair.
Ghost train guests. Roll up and
test your strength, the man in the
straw hat grumbles, with a rakish eye
for the lady in the long white dress.
A storm has caught the swingboats,
toppled circus tents, whirled the
whole magnificent house of cards
into ruins like the glass of a kaleidoscope.

It was always the anxiety,
the thin howl of instability, of fear,
that brokered the everyday
and steered the course of politics —
a force that crept invisibly into
every house and hurried every life along.
Hopes stirred by the dream of
social stability that never came
to pass in the squares and streets
where election posters in garish red
and black promised the moon and the stars.

That, however, every picture is just
a point of view, in which history dissolves
into familiar stories, each one running
its own course, seeming as if it might be
halted for a moment, but in truth irrevocable,
that was the doctrine of photography.
Your gaze leaped back and forth.

Five years later a spectacle of horror
breaks all attendance records: “The German
People’s Show: Fire Exhibit ‘Der roter Hahn.’”
The bird with flaming feathers
hops over the solemn city roofs.
A new talking point: civil air defense    ...
in the arcades of the old town
an army takes up position to extinguish
the conflagration, an armada of blackened vans.
The climax is when, in the dark of night,
a training house is set ablaze.
Fountains of foam and light, hurray!
The destruction of the city street gives
a foretaste of the future.
 

A million Reichsmarks is what it costs
the state to lose a little town,
40,000 a single farmer’s house.
Long before the bombs, the firestorm
in which the city will perish, the skies are
lit with signs that advertise fire insurance.
The hoses lie on the asphalt
like fat boa constrictors,
rolled up by exhausted men
who have tamed the inferno.
Dresden, the press proudly declares,
has the most modern fire service in Europe.
And with that Death, the bitter little man
from the old German fairy tales,
rubs his hands with glee.
In “Die Mücke,” a café with dancing,
ladies and gentlemen fox-trot across
the floor, flushed at the show.

And then it all went well again.
Legal protection and rescue services:
the state myths of the moment.
Soon there is child benefit and animal
welfare for our household cats and dogs.
Write that in a letter home to the ones you love
and remember the new tariffs:
“Airmail saves you precious time.”
 

Was that grandmother standing
in the crowd by the entrance hall
at Blüherpark, in a people’s queue
at the edge of the road, behind
the brown-shirted stewards? That tiny woman,
with a handbag clutched to her chest,
could really be her from behind.
(Very soon she will be pregnant, just
a girl eighteen years of age.
And then once more, while her husband,
butcher by trade, is already a soldier
marching his way through Europe.)

Another spring. Imperial gardens on display:
for six months the magic of flowers
seems to ease the effects of the new
constraints, the new laws.
A hymn to existence, a sacred hymn
to the beauty of nature around us,
the newspapers swoon in the
grandiose style of the times.
More powerful than any Olympiad,
closer to a feminine aesthetic sense,
like Hitler’s hands, eunuch-white.

Departure of the concert steamer, the Leipzig:
on the bank at the embarkation point,
swastika flags flutter in the summer breeze.
An ice cream seller has opened his parlor
on the quay and waits for the
regiments of Hitler Youth to pass.
The city is the clearing. What could it know
of the aerial shots that would reveal
its wound, long before the thunderclap
that always comes after lightning? Often
a forest of raised arms stood there.

Then all of a sudden no one knew
what it was that brought the madness,
turned their heads for twelve long years.
Time had moved on. Dumb force
drenched everything in a primal light.
The pavements gleamed and thunderclouds
rolled down across the bridges,
with the clatter of refugees,
handcarts and armored tanks.
 

And then I knew that the cursed history
of this people, from the moment they
had taken on that fatal badge,
could only be recounted from below.
From the cellars, the gray corners
of air-raid shelters, with the sirens
screaming, the children in their
moments of final helplessness.

I was born in Weißer Hirsch —
a wealthy quarter spared by the bombs.
And I exist, like these images exist,
that bear witness to a life gone by,
but say nothing of the dead. Mother
was in safety when the bombers came.
She recalls the blown-out windows,
white curtains streaming from them,
the scorching heat of the winter night.
A neighbor took the children in, sought
refuge in the cellar, that’s what saved them.
When the house was hit, the entrance
reduced to rubble, she took the children,
made for open country, to the meadows
by the Elbe, heading out of town.
That’s when the second wave rolled in
and unleashed the fire storm.

Those lines in the dust could be as nihilistic as any ephemeral gesture, or they could be the most hopeful, the most human impulse we possess. “Posterity is bullshit. This is where we always planned to end it,” says Halberg, well aware that there were still a full nine episodes to go in the projected 31-episode run, and that many shows could complete an entire plot cycle without much more screen time than that which he’d set aside for the denouement. “It was discussed at the outset, so don’t listen to Lin or James or any of the other whiners I should have let go at the halfway point.” A toast to the not rescued.

Every standard element is here: the gang is still drinking far too many cocktails in one sitting, Cain is a hypocrite, Adah exists only to be interpreted by the men, Father K is so borderline incoherent you almost wonder if he’s a malfunctioning robot.

118,From “Anagrams” [iv],"It is generally believed that the writers had to make the most of a low budget and that this led to the grim determination of writing through restriction, bottle episodes, and constraints. In reality the show was generously bankrolled by Thud, but several costly set pieces had been planned which depleted the kitty. Nevertheless, episode 4, comprising solely an intimate kitchen dialogue between Fr. K and Adah, remains a fan favorite. “It was one of the last things we shot,” recalls Halberg. “Kitty [Beaulieu, who plays Adah], had really got into the role by then which was important as we wanted to imply years of previous talk between

Kantian philosophy (the noumenon is a posited thing, object, or event which is known, if it is known at all, without the use of the senses), but it soon emerges that a violent overthrow of the church has taken place, the transept vandalized, Father K (and, we suppose, his ilk) booted out and replaced by patsies during The Hour of Botheration. Its having been titled shows that the recent event has already passed into myth — a further indication that there is no planned resistance. This augurs very ill, and the look on Adah’s face as Father K sobs in her lap really says it all. She realizes that she will have to act as leader, as cheerleader, as mother, as father to the household.",Art and Science
119,From “Anagrams” [iii],"Cain tended to break rules and saving the introduction of a principal character for episode 3 was the most signifcant early decision. Previously associated with both Cain and Fr. K, Adah had been away on a busi-
ness trip for three months, returning to find diplomatic relations between her country and its bellicose neighbor in tatters. Staff writer James Ingram recalls the atmosphere in the room when they realized that
the letters b, i, t, c, h, d, i, t, t, o were left over after Fr. K’s feverish definitions. “We just started opening windows and whooping at the world,” he says. “It was character defining. This was Adah in her own words

to take ownership of her in some way or in one very specific way. Indeed there is an unabashed eroticism to the episode, albeit entirely set in the corridor, which saw early accusations of gratuity. The show would grow accustomed to courting controversy in this way, occasionally falling foul of the Bechdel test (a scene cut from episode 12 featured Adah in conversation with herself about the two male leads for half an hour). Halberg remains impenitent. “Adah isn’t just the love interest — that’s exactly what we wanted to send up in this show. She’s supposed to be the rudder, the only one with a handle on the situation who might do something about it. Of course Cain and Father K just spend the whole time drooling and lusting after her: they’re imbeciles.”",Art and Science

standing there, poised to dis-

escaping him, tossed to & fro,

gaze wrenched from its angle
of purchase upon the world,
capsized, head now careened

of rock, eyes whiplashed into new
prospects, he drowns in fire,
enflamed, fine silk aquiver

Now at Laon, the Lugdunum
of the North, deposited on this citadel
of chalk, white arx, former
temple of Lug, the light-

god of the Gauls, & he,
this Celt from Hibernia, setting
foot on this podium, this puy,
this platform afloat

at cloud & wind height,
blown in from the septentrion,

breathes in the quintessence
of rains, alevel the briar’s
pinks, zone where water,
at first cold snap, turns to snow.

Fallen from fire. Autumn’s pure light
whitens the mount, the tufa
reverberating the radiance
of a Cyclades isle, here mis-

placed, high above these plains,
by some error in translation.

At Lindisfarne, let us suppose —
even if Alcuin’s letters to the island’s
monks exhorting them to combat
the Viking may be evidence

to the contrary — that he studied
Greek, that Charles the Bald,
offshoot of the Pippinids,
summoned him here to Laon

to translate Dionysus. Between
the king’s vineyards & the blue sky,

a whisper of the North Sea
in the channel of Île Sainte when
the seals bark at ebb tide,
Johannes the Hibernian cocks an ear

despite finding his coracle of Latin
too frail a craft to explore the peninsulas
of Greek, & carries with him
the long-lapping waves of Scotland

& seaweed’s tang where kingfisher
nests beside nugget of amber.

That which lies out of reach taking
the shape of this white & shadowy
rock on which he is now beached
& whose slope he now climbs, blind

beneath the sun, fallen from the same height
he ascends, would Satan be extending him
his welcome with the same dark
radiance of stone between his eyes

& the same fine peppering of pinks
that spice his senses on either side

of the stairs, against this, what whiteness,
what candor? The sky’s rarified air,
there to calculate the distances between
the things he climbs or descends,

the divisions of the world now
extended, now illuminated between the lines,
the borders of the intangible now flaring up
with darkness, the granular opacities

now brightening, the sun biting into
the margins of the real, the image dying.

Denys, foundation of all cathedrals
to come, mentor of naves, stained glass
rosettes, of all the gossamer shadow
spiderwebbing the light from the East

as it rises, Lord of Ionia, oriental
Ionas, Denys, Dionysos,
your Greek sailing the great hill
of Lugdunum, your darkness raining down

its alphas, its Alphei, the dawn
uncorking the fizz of its dations.

John Scotus comments, his violet ink
relighting, igniting the world according
to Plato, filtering the grit of the flower
through the sieve of the eye,

the bran, the curds of light,
sifting out the clots of theology,
in this shadowy cave, the locals
burning every log in sight, hoc lignum,

a bonfire of stones
held in common, lapis iste.

  6

And if some hick might ask
Quomodo omnia, quae sunt,
lumina sunt? the master
picks up a stone, a rock

from the Laon vineyard, applies
his know-how to the refractory
matter at hand, crumbles it, cake
of honey humming with the blue

of the ambient sky, the clarity,
the tang, the silky feel of the stone

giving rise to the precise & exact
idea whose line cuts against another
idea, steps hewn, crossing over
into each other, pebble giving rise

to temple, tensile, acts of attention
& hierarchy of effects, blueprints
polished to perfection, prayer
welcomed into its breast by the increase

of the volume of silence springing
from ribbed ogives, from angles.

He holds Ireland in his hand
like Carolus Magnus the Apple
of Empire surmounted by the Cross.
To distance oneself from idolatry

means, first & foremost, to gather
together the Earth in godly fashion,
to harden its pit, its core, its blindness
to the sun, its heart of darkness

according to Denys, then to hurl
this handful of earth skywards, so

that it take flight & light like a ball
of sun, cormorant, black oriflamme,
that it crackle chalky winey in the blue
veins of Ouranos, welcomed into

the sack of the crystal vault like a ripe
cherry fallen from its tree in June
among the rungs of the ladder,
if hurled from this great a distance

Earth is no more than a fruit’s seed
in the scrumptious season of God.

  8

In the treading vats of Laon, the light
squirts out from underfoot, the Greek
hill bleeds a wine lighter & clearer
than the juice of Santorini,

the vat tips over, the blue gushes out,
the sheer flood of the world saves it
from being swallowed up, God
has created things as numerous as

his glory, hilaritas! Night overtakes
joy on the hill, the winter of all things

recedes into God, from whom they
so luminously proceed, & we philosophers
who make our way by foot, following
the path of photodosia, we reach

the degrees of the world inasmuch
as we take pleasure in its ascent,
Earth in one hand, knees in Earth,
pilgrimage of humility,

voyage of hilarity to the Mount
of Laon, Mountain of Time.

Neither a philosophical God nor a biblical God

amid revelations of wisdom in Jerusalem, His city.
And certainly not in disclosures of pious inner principles
and also not among poets, unfortunately.

and Beit Jala
bear His between-the-lines existence,
His inklings.

God is an idea —
ideas don’t have material existence
but they exist nonetheless
so God exists definitively as the spirit of an idea,
the biblical assertion “He has no body and no bodily form”
is clear to me now as an exegesis
that sits well with philosophy.

I wished someone would write a song for me, then someone did

life, form, limit, fate. To be bodied. To strut. To have
meaning. How easily we wear ourselves
as if it is nothing to have
origin, whirl, outcome, end      and still be.

After the high winds stop you’re forced to hear
the freshness of what’s

say—crazed investigation, tentative prophecy trying on savage
shape, figure, progression—widening without be-
coming. Is this the last war now, finally—but no, only more of notion’s

motions—more more the wind says, break grief, loosen possibility, let vague
hopes float, sink—let other debris slip into

brocading the emptiness. Then suddenly

all stills. It is near noon. No more

159,Pyramid Scheme,"For RWT
the other day i was thinking about the term pyramid scheme, and why they called it pyramid scheme and not triangle scheme
and i asked you what you thought
you thought it added a certain gravitas, and linked the idea of economic prosperity
with some of history’s greatest architectural achievements
unconsciously suggesting a silent wealth of gold and heat
a triangle is two dimensional, and therefore
a less striking mental image than the idea of a third dimension of financial fraud
which is how many dimensions of financial fraud the term pyramid scheme suggests
but i had to pause for a second at the financial fraud part
because it occurred to me i didn’t know what pyramid schemes really were
i knew they had something to do with people getting money from nothing
like
the person at the top of the pyramid scheme, or more accurately
triangle scheme, acquires a number of investors and takes their money
and then pays the first lot of investors with the money from another bunch of investors
and so on and so forth
all the way to the bottom of the triangle
or pyramid face
which is the kind of stupid thing that happens
if you keep your money in a pyramid and not a bank account
although if you ask me banks are the real pyramid schemes after all
or was love the real pyramid scheme? i can’t remember

maybe it’s better to keep your money in a pyramid than a bank
and i should shop around and compare the interest rates on different pyramids
maybe i should open up a savings pyramid
with a whole bunch of trapdoors and malarias
to keep the financial anthropologists
i mean bankers out
my emeralds cooling under the ground like beautiful women’s eyes

i think this was supposed to be a metaphor for something
but i can’t remember where i was going with it
and now it’s been swept away by the winds of
whatever
but knowing me, it was probably love
that great dark blue sex hope that keeps coming true
that cartoon black castle with a single bird flying over it

i don’t know where this poem ends
how far below the sand
but it’s still early evening
and you and I are a little drunk
you answer the phone
you pour me a drink
i know you hate the domestic in poetry but you should have thought of that before you invited me to move in with you
i used to think arguments were the same as honesty
i used to think screaming was the same as passion
i used to think pain was meaningful
i no longer think pain is meaningful
i never learned anything good from being unhappy
i never learned anything good from being happy either
the way i feel about you has nothing to do with learning
it has nothing to do with anything
but i feel it down in the corners of my sarcophagus
i feel it in my sleep
even when i am not thinking about you
you are still pouring through my blood, like fire through an abandoned hospital ward
these coins are getting heavy on my eyes
it has been a great honor and privilege to love you
it has been a great honor and privilege to eat cold pizza on your steps at dawn
love is so stupid: it’s like punching the sun
and having a million gold coins rain down on you
which you don’t even have to pay tax on
because sun money is free money
and i’m pretty sure there are no laws about that
but i would pay tax
because i believe that hospitals and education
and the arts should be publicly funded
even this poem
when i look at you, my eyes are two identical neighborhood houses on fire
when i look at you my eyes bulge out of my skull like a dog in a cartoon
when i am with you
an enormous silence descends upon me
and i feel like i am sinking into the deepest part of my life

Not a thing to be remembered,
The field-holler tradition of
Teeth and knees
Cursing wind,
A concert hall of   bloody hands
Spilling the earth,
Strangling dirt,
Sledgehammer curses
Of  men busted open.

On Parchman Farm
You could hear it coming
Up through the trees,
The hammering pulpit of
Crooning men and sweat,
The tender meat of palms
Pulped like plums.

Them men gulped down the
Dawn dew air,
Let it catch in their throats,
Broke the sunrise up and
Sang hymns like hexes:

Be my woman gal, I’ll beeee your maaaaaaan    ...

And the killing fields of  Mississippi
Fizzled down to juke joints and
The hothouse music of illegal clubs
With thick women they loved outright and
Played cards with and
Gave bourbon to when their hands
Didn’t hold sorrow like
Pickaxes and the railroad was
Just a railroad,
A way to ride north if  you could
Get your money right.

When they lifted their knees
Sunflower County was a heaven
They believed in.

Their hard, hard hands,
Let the memory of fresh linen and
Ladies’ slips like gossamer
Wings, a parade of  plump thighs,
The juju thrust of  furious bones
Spread like grease
Across starched-white sheets,
Midwife them out of ol’ Parchman Farm

And back to the cockfights and gambling,
Back when they had ambition,
Back when they had a sweet woman
To hold, her fat wrists
Soft as butter,
Limp as rain.

When she walk, she reel and rock beeeeeehind
Ain’t that enough to make a convict smiiiiiiiiile.

Mississippi’s where the cock crowed,
A hoodwink if ever there was one,
But see how a man can make a
Steeple outta his hands,

See how he can break away
From his hurt and be God
If  he wants to,
How he can keep his mind
Wrapped in yesterday,
Drown out memory
Like rain drumming
Down like hornets
Yeahhhhhh.

Them Parchman men,
Ants in single file,
Draft dodgers
Digging trenches
Pounding concrete
Laying tracks
Pretending it’s Christmas
So they can keep their hands
Away from the colic of axe handles,
The sputtering earth
Snarling under their feet.
Warden says every man
Gotta pay his way on Parchman Farm
Same as the outside.

Yessuh. They remember what it was like to be a man,
To know that didn’t mean put a gun in your hand

They sang ’til the hurt was just an
Experiment in forgetfulness and they
Were back in clean clothes makin’ plans and

Tryin’ to get a little money
To buy tobacco and
A pint with a little left over
To get somethin’ sweet
For the women who were wet
Underneath them, crooning
A tumorless midnight.

Their clothes are off.

We goin’ Saturday, baby
When you gon’ get you a steady job?
Workin’ on it everyday, baby
Why you love me anyway, man?
Ain’t a man alive who could help it

The dance, you know, the dance of  being a free man
That never shows its fullness to you ’til
It’s stripped down and gobbled up
By railroad tracks and guards in high towers
With rifles watching your back,
Bend to question mark
Under a sun that won’t mind its business,

When the only part of  your living life left
Is in the things you remember
About a woman who hung
Pantyhose off her porch to
Dry and made you peach cobbler
In the middle of the night
If you asked nice and
Danced with you to songs
Written on the back of a
Watermelon truck by folk who
Knew something about longing,
And those are the songs you give her now
While you bust the earth open.

Cuz your heart is a burial plot
So stony.

Can’t ask nothin’ of a grave.
Everybody knows that.

In the high noon of the heavenly garden
Where the angels sunned with the birds,
Beauty, before their hearts could harden,
Had taught them heavenly words.

When they fled in the burning weather
And nothing dawned but a dream,
Beauty fasted their hands together
And cooled them at her stream.

And when day wearied and night grew stronger,
And they slept as the beautiful must,
Then she bided a little longer,
And blossomed from their dust.",Love

The garden had fallen still;
He bade his soul rise upward
And stand on her window-sill.

It rose in a straight blue garment,
When owls began to call:
It had grown wise-tongued by thinking
Of a quiet and light footfall;

But the young queen would not listen;
She rose in her pale night-gown;
She drew in the heavy casement
And pushed the latches down.

He bade his heart go to her,
When the owls called out no more;
In a red and quivering garment
It sang to her through the door.

It had grown sweet-tongued by dreaming
Of a flutter of flower-like hair;
But she took up her fan from the table
And waved it off on the air.

'I have cap and bells, he pondered,
'I will send them to her and die;
And when the morning whitened
He left them where she went by.

She laid them upon her bosom,
Under a cloud of her hair,
And her red lips sang them a love-song
Till stars grew out of the air.

She opened her door and her window,
And the heart and the soul came through,
To her right hand came the red one,
To her left hand came the blue.

Yours is the shame and sorrow,
But the disgrace is mine;
Your love was dark and thorough,
Mine was the love of the sun for a flower
He creates with his shine.

I was diligent to explore you,
Blossom you stalk by stalk,
Till my fire of creation bore you
Shrivelling down in the final dour
Anguish  then I suffered a balk.

I knew your pain, and it broke
My fine, craftsman's nerve;
Your body quailed at my stroke,
And my courage failed to give you the last
Fine torture you did deserve.

You are shapely, you are adorned,
But opaque and dull in the flesh,
Who, had I but pierced with the thorned
Fire-threshing anguish, were fused and cast
In a lovely illumined mesh.

Like a painted window: the best
Suffering burnt through your flesh,
Undrossed it and left it blest
With a quivering sweet wisdom of grace: but now
Who shall take you afresh?

Now who will burn you free
From your body's terrors and dross,
Since the fire has failed in me?
What man will stoop in your flesh to plough
The shrieking cross?

A mute, nearly beautiful thing
Is your face, that fills me with shame
As I see it hardening,
Warping the perfect image of God,
And darkening my eternal fame.

Version 2 (1928)
Yours is the sullen sorrow,
The disgrace is also mine;
Your love was intense and thorough,
Mine was the love of a growing flower

You had the power to explore me,
Blossom me stalk by stalk;
You woke my spirit, you bore me
To consciousness, you gave me the dour
Awareness  then I suffered a balk.

Body to body I could not
Love you, although I would.
We kissed, we kissed though we should not.
You yielded, we threw the last cast,
And it was no good.

You only endured, and it broke
My craftsman's nerve.
No flesh responded to my stroke;
So I failed to give you the last
Fine torture you did deserve.

You are shapely, you are adorned
But opaque and null in the flesh;
Who, had I but pierced with the thorned
Full anguish, perhaps had been cast
In a lovely illuinined mesh

Fire passed through your flesh,
Undrossed it, and left it blest
In clean new awareness. But now
Who shall take you afresh?

Now who will burn you free

193,The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,"Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
Oh, do not ask, What is it?
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And indeed there will be time
To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair 
(They will say: How his hair is growing thin!)
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin 
(They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!)
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

For I have known them all already, known them all:
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
               So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them all
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
               And how should I presume?

And I have known the arms already, known them all
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
               And should I then presume?
               And how should I begin?

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...

I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet  and heres no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it towards some overwhelming question,
To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all
If one, settling a pillow by her head
               Should say: That is not what I meant at all;
               That is not it, at all.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while,
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor
And this, and so much more?
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
               That is not it at all,
               That is not what I meant, at all.

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous
Almost, at times, the Fool.

I grow old ... I grow old ...
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.",Love
194,Lucinda Matlock,"I went to the dances at Chandlerville,
And played snap-out at Winchester.
One time we changed partners,
Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,
And then I found Davis.
We were married and lived together for seventy years,
Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,
Eight of whom we lost
Ere I had reached the age of sixty.
I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,
I made the garden, and for holiday
Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,
And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,
And many a flower and medicinal weed 
Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.
At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,
And passed to a sweet repose.

Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?
Degenerate sons and daughters,

Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
And in some perfumes is there more delight
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;

The woman I might grow to be;

And then turn suddenly to me.

Her hair was dull and drew no light
And yet its color was as mine;
Her eyes were strangely like my eyes
Tho' love had never made them shine.

Her body was a thing grown thin,
Hungry for love that never came;
Her soul was frozen in the dark
Unwarmed forever by love's flame.

Just as my fingers on these keys
Make music, so the selfsame sounds
On my spirit make a music, too.

Music is feeling, then, not sound;
And thus it is that what I feel,
Here in this room, desiring you,

Thinking of your blue-shadowed silk,
Is music. It is like the strain
Waked in the elders by Susanna: 

Of a green evening, clear and warm,
She bathed in her still garden, while
The red-eyed elders, watching, felt

The basses of their beings throb
In witching chords, and their thin blood
Pulse pizzicati of Hosanna.

In the green water, clear and warm,
Susanna lay.
She searched
The touch of springs,
And found
Concealed imaginings.
She sighed,
For so much melody.

Upon the bank, she stood
In the cool
Of spent emotions.
She felt, among the leaves,
The dew
Of old devotions.

She walked upon the grass,
Still quavering.
The winds were like her maids,
On timid feet,
Fetching her woven scarves,
Yet wavering.

A breath upon her hand
Muted the night.
She turned
A cymbal crashed,
And roaring horns.

Soon, with a noise like tambourines,
Came her attendant Byzantines.

They wondered why Susanna cried
Against the elders by her side;

And as they whispered, the refrain
Was like a willow swept by rain.

Anon, their lamps' uplifted flame
Revealed Susanna and her shame.

And then, the simpering Byzantines
Fled, with a noise like tambourines.

Beauty is momentary in the mind
The fitful tracing of a portal;
But in the flesh it is immortal.

The body dies; the body's beauty lives.
So evenings die, in their green going,
A wave, interminably flowing.
So gardens die, their meek breath scenting
The cowl of winter, done repenting.
So maidens die, to the auroral
Celebration of a maiden's choral.

Susanna's music touched the bawdy strings
Of those white elders; but, escaping,
Left only Death's ironic scraping.
Now, in its immortality, it plays
On the clear viol of her memory,
And makes a constant sacrament of praise.",Love
199,Portrait of a Lady,"I
Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
You have the scene arrange itself  as it will seem to do
With ""I have saved this afternoon for you"";
And four wax candles in the darkened room,
Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
""So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
Should be resurrected only among friends
Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.""
And so the conversation slips
Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
Through attenuated tones of violins
Mingled with remote cornets
And begins.

""You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,
And how, how rare and strange it is, to find
In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,
(For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind!
How keen you are!)
To find a friend who has these qualities,
Who has, and gives
Those qualities upon which friendship lives.
How much it means that I say this to you 
Without these friendships  life, what cauchemar!""
Among the winding of the violins
And the ariettes
Of cracked cornets
Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins
Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,
Capricious monotone
That is at least one definite ""false note.""
 Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,
Admire the monuments,
Discuss the late events,
Correct our watches by the public clocks.
Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.

She has a bowl of lilacs in her room
And twists one in her fingers while she talks.
""Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know
What life is, you who hold it in your hands"";
(Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)
""You let it flow from you, you let it flow,
And youth is cruel, and has no remorse
And smiles at situations which it cannot see.""
I smile, of course,
And go on drinking tea.
""Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall
My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,
I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world
To be wonderful and youthful, after all.""

The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune
Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:
""I am always sure that you understand
My feelings, always sure that you feel,
Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.

You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.
You will go on, and when you have prevailed
You can say: at this point many a one has failed.

But what have I, but what have I, my friend,
To give you, what can you receive from me?
Only the friendship and the sympathy
Of one about to reach her journey's end.

I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....""

I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends
For what she has said to me?
You will see me any morning in the park
Reading the comics and the sporting page.
Particularly I remark.
An English countess goes upon the stage.
A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,
Another bank defaulter has confessed.
I keep my countenance,
I remain self-possessed
Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired
Reiterates some worn-out common song
With the smell of hyacinths across the garden
Recalling things that other people have desired.
Are these ideas right or wrong?

III
The October night comes down; returning as before
Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease
I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door
And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.
""And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?
But that's a useless question.
You hardly know when you are coming back,
You will find so much to learn.""
My smile falls heavily among the bric-a-brac.

""Perhaps you can write to me.""
My self-possession flares up for a second;
This is as I had reckoned.
""I have been wondering frequently of late
(But our beginnings never know our ends!)
Why we have not developed into friends.""
I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark
Suddenly, his expression in a glass.
My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.

""For everybody said so, all our friends,
They all were sure our feelings would relate
So closely! I myself can hardly understand.
We must leave it now to fate.
You will write, at any rate.
Perhaps it is not too late.
I shall sit here, serving tea to friends.""
And I must borrow every changing shape
To find expression ... dance, dance
Like a dancing bear,
Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.
Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance
Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,
Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;
Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand
With the smoke coming down above the housetops;
Doubtful, for quite a while
Not knowing what to feel or if I understand
Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ...
Would she not have the advantage, after all?
This music is successful with a ""dying fall""
Now that we talk of dying
And should I have the right to smile?",Love
200,A Tale,"This youth too long has heard the break
Of waters in a land of change.
He goes to see what suns can make
From soil more indurate and strange.

He cuts what holds his days together
And shuts him in, as lock on lock:
The arrowed vane announcing weather,
The tripping racket of a clock;

Seeking, I think, a light that waits
Still as a lamp upon a shelf, 
A land with hills like rocky gates
Where no sea leaps upon itself.

But he will find that nothing dares
To be enduring, save where, south
Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares
On beauty with a rusted mouth, 

Where something dreadful and another
Look quietly upon each other.",Love
201,Tortoise Gallantry,"Making his advances
He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,
No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.

Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin
That work beneath her while she sprawls along
In her ungainly pace,
Her folds of skin that work and row
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.

And so he strains beneath her housey walls
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak
Suddenly, or her skinny limb,
And strange and grimly drags at her
Like a dog,
Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.

Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation
And doomed to partiality, partial being,
Ache, and want of being,
Want,
Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.

Born to walk alone,
Forerunner,
Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,
This awkward, harrowing pursuit,
This grim necessity from within.

Does she know
As she moves eternally slowly away?
Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,
All knowledgeless?

The awful concussion,
And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,
Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,
At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,
Driven away from himself into her tracks,
Forced to crash against her.

Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,
Little gentleman,
Sorry plight,
We ought to look the other way.

Save that, having come with you so far,
We will go on to the end.",Love
202,Tortoise Shout,"I thought he was dumb,
I said he was dumb,
Yet I've heard him cry.

First faint scream,
Out of life's unfathomable dawn,
Far off, so far, like a madness, under the horizon's dawning rim,
Far, far off, far scream.

Tortoise in extremis.

Why were we crucified into sex?
Why were we not left rounded off, and finished in ourselves,
As we began,
As he certainly began, so perfectly alone?

A far, was-it-audible scream,
Or did it sound on the plasm direct?

Worse than the cry of the new-born,
A scream,
A yell,
A shout,
A pan,
A death-agony,
A birth-cry,
A submission,
All tiny, tiny, far away, reptile under the first dawn.

War-cry, triumph, acute-delight, death-scream reptilian,
Why was the veil torn?
The silken shriek of the soul's torn membrane?
The male soul's membrane
Torn with a shriek half music, half horror.

Crucifixion.
Male tortoise, cleaving behind the hovel-wall of that dense female,
Mounted and tense, spread-eagle, out-reaching out of the shell
In tortoise-nakedness,
Long neck, and long vulnerable limbs extruded, spread-eagle over her house-roof,
And the deep, secret, all-penetrating tail curved beneath her walls,
Reaching and gripping tense, more reaching anguish in uttermost tension
Till suddenly, in the spasm of coition, tupping like a jerking leap, and oh!
Opening its clenched face from his outstretched neck
And giving that fragile yell, that scream,
Super-audible,
From his pink, cleft, old-man's mouth,
Giving up the ghost,
Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.

His scream, and his moment's subsidence,
The moment of eternal silence,
Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once
The inexpressible faint yell 
And so on, till the last plasm of my body was melted back
To the primeval rudiments of life, and the secret.

So he tups, and screams
Time after time that frail, torn scream
After each jerk, the longish interval,
The tortoise eternity,
Agelong, reptilian persistence,
Heart-throb, slow heart-throb, persistent for the next spasm.

I remember, when I was a boy,
I heard the scream of a frog, which was caught with his foot in the mouth of an up-starting snake;
I remember when I first heard bull-frogs break into sound in the spring;
I remember hearing a wild goose out of the throat of night
Cry loudly, beyond the lake of waters;
I remember the first time, out of a bush in the darkness, a nightingale's piercing cries and gurgles startled the depths of my soul;
I remember the scream of a rabbit as I went through a wood at midnight;
I remember the heifer in her heat, blorting and blorting through the hours, persistent and irrepressible;
I remember my first terror hearing the howl of weird, amorous cats;
I remember the scream of a terrified, injured horse, the sheet-lightning
And running away from the sound of a woman in labor, something like an owl whooing,
And listening inwardly to the first bleat of a lamb,
The first wail of an infant,
And my mother singing to herself,
And the first tenor singing of the passionate throat of a young collier, who has long since drunk himself to death,
The first elements of foreign speech
On wild dark lips.

And more than all these,
And less than all these,
This last,
Strange, faint coition yell
Of the male tortoise at extremity,
Tiny from under the very edge of the farthest far-off horizon of life.

The cross,
The wheel on which our silence first is broken,
Sex, which breaks up our integrity, our single inviolability, our deep silence
Tearing a cry from us.

Sex, which breaks us into voice, sets us calling across the deeps, calling, calling for the complement,
Singing, and calling, and singing again, being answered, having found.

Torn, to become whole again, after long seeking for what is lost,
The same cry from the tortoise as from Christ, the Osiris-cry of abandonment,
That which is whole, torn asunder,
That which is in part, finding its whole again throughout the universe.",Love

That were light as a snowflake falling;
Ah well that he never leaned to hear
The words my heart was calling.

And on we walked and on we walked
Past the fiery lights of the picture shows 
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by
On the errand each man knows.

And on we walked and on we walked,
At the door at last we said good-bye;
I knew by his smile he had not heard
My heart's unuttered cry.

How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,

To be admired of lewd unhallowed eyes.

Without the bed her other fair hand was,
On the green coverlet, whose perfect white
Showed like an April daisy on the grass,
With pearly sweat resembling dew of night.
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay
Till they might open to adorn the day.

Her hair like golden threads played with her breath
O modest wantons, wanton modesty!
Showing lifes triumph in the map of death,
And deaths dim look in lifes mortality.

But that life lived in death, and death in life.

Her breasts like ivory globes circled with blue,
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,

Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.

Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
So oer this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
His rage of lust by gazing qualified;
Slacked, not suppressed; for, standing by her side,
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins.

And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting.
In bloody death and ravishment delighting,
Nor childrens tears nor mothers groans respecting,
Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting.
Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.

His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
His eye commends the leading to his hand;

Do tell her she is dreadfully beset
And fright her with confusion of their cries.
She, much amazed, breaks ope her locked-up eyes,

Are by his flaming torch dimmed and controlled.

Imagine her as one in dead of night
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,

From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view

Wrapped and confounded in a thousand fears,

Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs;

Where rivers smoothest run, deep are the fords;

Can true love yield such delay,
Converting joy to pain?

Lost is our freedom,

The mouse which once hath broken out of trap

The scorched fly, which once hath scaped the flame,

There she beholding me with milder look,
Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:

At wondrous sight of so celestial hue.
So when my tongue would speak her praises due,

It ravish'd is with fancy's wonderment:

Was daily wrought, to turn to Britains gain.

A visage, stern and mild; where both did grow,
Vice to condemn, in virtues to rejoice;
Amid great storms whom grace assured so,

A hand that taught what might be said in rhyme;
That reft Chaucer the glory of his wit;
A mark the which (unperfited, for time)

Each noble heart; a worthy guide to bring
Our English youth, by travail unto fame.

An eye whose judgment no affect could blind,
Friends to allure, and foes to reconcile;

With virtue fraught, reposed, void of guile.

In neither fortune lift, nor so repressed,
To swell in wealth, nor yield unto mischance.

A valiant corps, where force and beauty met,
Happy, alas! too happy, but for foes,

A blankness swoons upon him, and he hears
Nothing but the white vowels of the wind

While a banner slips its staff and hangs in the blue
Like a kestrel or a contrail. The hero’s death,
The prize, elusive quarry of his life,
Stands stock-still in her cloven tracks in snow

One dished towards him. Her unstartled gaze
Beads on him like a sniper’s sights, until

listening to the radio-talk of the ships: barges dead
in the calms awaiting port call, pleasure boats whose lights
hours ago went out, fishermen setting their nets for mullet,
as summer tavernas hang octopus to dry on their lines,
whisper smoke into wood ovens, sweep the terraces
clear of night, putting the music out with morning
light, and for the breath of an hour it is possible

scavenged on the seafloor and in its caves, belongings now
a flotsam washed to the rocks. Stand here and look

into the tough waves. Rest your eyes there, remembering the words

378,Dog Head,"Our mascot was the bulldog. Bulldogs chased me across playgrounds
until I dreamed them. In class, I finished mazes with a green crayon.
Hedges grew skyward from pages, and I ran. My dad once called
this kind of thing my day-head. When my day-head happened,
they called him at his office. I learned the name Daedalus from an article
I read for science class. It meant a plane with leg-powered wings —
carbon tubing, plastic skin. A man with a long name flew a longer way
across the sea from Crete. At recess, I reread the same book
of illustrated myths and cryptids. I dreamed of bulldogs with bulls’ heads.
My day-head was a zoo where gods slept. Daedalus sounded like dad,
so I loved him. Class was an enclosure made of cinder block
and twelve weeks without winter. Behind the glass, my day-head paced.
Daedalus was a zookeeper. I dreamed of a god with a bull’s body
and a hood sewn from my face. The article said I weighed the same
as the Daedalus. I traced flight plans and crash sites on my desk.
My teacher asked us to draw self-portraits. The trees were hydras.
On the paper, I drew an outline of my face. I cut my eyes out
with scissors. They called me to the office, and Daedalus was waiting.
I found a bulldog in a magazine and drew a maze inside each iris.
We played tug-of-war in gym. My day-head was a knotted rope
dangling from steel rafters. I pushed my thumb into the sun. I fell once.
I cut the bulldog from the page, then ripped his head in two.
I glued one half over the left side of my face. I left the right side blank.
The article said the Daedalus crashed twenty-one feet from the black sand

384,Like Gods,"The philosopher David Lewis spun a fantasy of two omniscient gods who know about one world, which might as well be ours. Each knows precisely all there is to know, the grand “totality of facts, not things.” Each knows the pattern of the light on each neglected leaf millennia ago. Each knows the number of the stars, their ages, all the distances between them, all the “things too tiny to be remembered in recorded history—the backfiring of a bus/In a Paris street in 1932,” as well as all the things that history distorts or just can’t see, like the thought that must have flashed across Patroklos’s mind (if he’d existed and had had a mind—the middle knowledge of the schoolmen) when Hektor split his stomach with a spear (if he’d existed too). Each one looks on, as though through ordinary eyes, as “Mme Swann’s enormous coachman, supervised by a groom no bigger than his fist and as infantile as St George in the picture, endeavored to curb the ardour of the quivering steel-tipped pinions with which they thundered over the ground,” and sees “the gray ‘toppers’ of old” the gentlemen strolling with her wore, the little “woolen cap from which stuck out two blade-like partridge feathers” that she wore (or would have worn if they and she’d been real). Each monitors the photons through the slits, the slow decay of radium, and knows the ratio of vermouth to gin in someone’s first martini at Larre’s. Each knows what Darragh, Geoff and Willy knew before the bullet or the pavement killed their worlds, and where the shots came from in Dallas. Each knows precisely what the other knows, in all the senses of those words, and if a question has a factual answer, each can answer it. Yet there’s a question neither can resolve: which god am I?

The question posits both a world and a unique perspective on that world, which neither has. And if gods One and Two could reify themselves by wondering who or what they were, they’d have to know the answer—and, because they don’t, they can’t. Could gods like those be real, in something like the sense that you and I are real? But then, what sense is that? Gods One and Two are you and I writ large: I wander out into the day and feel the sunlight on my face. I see the sunlight on the first spring leaves like green foam on the trees, and so do you. The world we have in common, that the gods can comprehend in its entirety, remains beyond my grasp, and yours. The world I know belongs entirely to me, as yours belongs entirely to you. I know my world completely, as the gods know ours, because it’s nothing but my take on things, and starts and ends with me. I’m both the author and the captive of my world, because my take on things is all there is to me. When Mary, in Frank Jackson’s philosophical diversion, wanders from her room of black and white and shades of gray and finally sees a rose, and then goes on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten, and drinks coffee, and talks for hours, it’s hard to see how all of this (as she might say) could be an artifact of her perspective. But it is.

So what? Philosophers tell stories, but they make them up, and what are they to me? Sometimes I think I’m humoring myself (a good thing I suppose) with an extended exercise in nonsense. Have breakfast, have a cup of strong black common sense, get over it, I tell myself, refuting Berkeley with my foot. Instead of this entanglement of self with self, why can’t I just relax into my place inside the natural order, be a thing within the solid scheme of things, a Dane in Denmark? How can fantasies, unreal by definition, show me what I am, and know? How can the poetry of possibilities dissolve the prose of facts? My little life sustains me while it can, and that’s enough. It may be all contingent, but it’s real, and when catastrophes occur, as they inevitably do, I’d rather they occur to me, instead of writing them away, or redefining happiness or sorrow or tranquility as alterations of some abstract point of view that points at nothing. Inescapable illusions must be real, or might as well be real, no matter where reflection on them leads; and if accepting them means taking things on faith, that’s fine. Who wants to be a posit, or a site of possibilities? Who wants to walk out and evaporate into this green spring day? Who wants to have sex with a wraith?

No matter where reflection on them leads. It leads, of course, to me. A cri de coeur is not an argument, but where the real argument begins. Hopkins: “searching nature I taste self at one tankard, that of my own being.” Kant: “the feeling of an existence without the least concept,” meaning that despite the certainty I have, I’ve no idea what I really am, or where, and as for “searching nature,” I have no idea even where to start. These matters mean the world to me, and yet no matter how I try to come to grips with them, they slip away. I and here and now are ever present, yet they vanish in the act of apprehension, as a poem turns into language as you write it down. Dimensionless, atemporal, imprisoned in the present—even as I say them to myself the words fall short of what I thought I started out to say, like the conclusion of an argument too close to me to share, or like an empty thought balloon that hangs above me in the air. It’s not the question of what makes me who I am through time—of how a figure in a photograph from 1985, a couple sitting in the garden of the small Hôtel des Marronniers just off the rue Jacob, could be the person who remembers her and thinks of him today—but of what constitutes me now, and of what made me then. If giving it a name won’t help, then neither will pretending it’s divine. If I should be supplanted by a bright recording angel knowing everything about me in the way the gods know all about their world, I wouldn’t have survived. She takes the whole thing in—the house on Maxim Street, the bike rides down the hill on Wabash Street, my high school friends, their friends, the friends of friends of friends—with eyes that monitor my back, my face, the traces in my brain projected on a screen, the n degrees of separation linking me to nearly everyone who’s ever lived, a thing within a wilderness of things, with each one locked inside a universe with no outside, of which there’s nothing she can see. How could it be an afterlife? It’s just a different life, another life, complete or incomplete as anyone’s, consumed by questions that elude it, not because she can’t remember, but because the words that make them up are undefined: which one of them was I? which world was mine?",Mythology and Folklore

There is no chance of trees                 or anyplace       for birds to live.

The size of the sun, redbirds, and were greeted

                                          By chickadees with their good morning songs.

We’d started to cook outside slippery with dew and laughter, ah those smoky sweet sunrises.

We tried to pretend war wasn’t going to happen.

Though they began building their houses all around us and demanding more.

They started teaching our children their god’s story,

No. Not here.

You can’t begin here.

This is memory shredded because it is impossible to hold by words, even poetry.


These memories were left here with the trees:

The torn pocket of your daughter’s hand-sewn dress,

The sash, the lace.

The baby’s delicately beaded moccasin still connected to the foot,

A young man’s note of promise to his beloved —


                                                                              No! This is not the best place to begin.


Everyone was asleep, despite the distant bombs. Terror had become the familiar stranger.

Our beloved twin girls curled up in their nightgowns, next to their father and me.



If we begin here, none of us will make it to the end

Someone has to make it out alive, sang a grandfather to his grandson,

His granddaughter, as he blew his most powerful song into the hearts of the children.

There it would be hidden from the soldiers,

Who would take them miles, rivers, mountains from the navel cord place

Of the origin story.

He knew one day, far day, the grandchildren would return, generations later

Over slick highways                             constructed over old trails

Through walls of laws meant to hamper or destroy, over the libraries of

391,"""Phoebus was gone, all gone, his journey over""","Phoebus was gone, all gone, his journey over.
His sister was riding high: nothing bridled her.
Her light was falling, shining into woods and rivers.
Wild animals opened their jaws wide, stirred to prey.
But in the human world all was sleep, pause, relaxation, torpor.

One night, in an April which had just gone by,
The likeness of my love stood beside me suddenly.
He called my name so quietly. He touched me gently.
His voice was drowning in tears. It failed completely.
His sighs overwhelmed him. Finally, he could not speak clearly.

I shuddered at his touch. I felt the fear of it.
I trembled as if I knew the true terror of it.
I opened my arms wide and pressed him against my body.
Then I froze: I was ice, all ice. My blood drained into it.
He had fled. Here was my embrace—and there was nothing in it.

Fully awake now, I cried out loudly:
""Where are you fleeing to? Why are you rushing away?
Wait, wait for me. If you want, I can enter there.
Because the truth is, I want to live with you forever.""
But soon I regretted it—that I had spoken out this way.

And all the time, the windows of the terrace had been wide open.   
The light of the moon poured down; its beauty, its radiance.
And I grieved and grieved. I grieved for so long.

392,The Rape of Europa,"From ""Metamorphoses,"" Book II, 846-875
Majesty is incompatible truly with love; they cohabit
Nowhere together. The father and chief of the gods, whose right hand is   
Armed with the triple-forked lightning, who shakes the whole world with a nod, laid   
Dignity down with his sceptre, adopting the guise of a bull that   
Mixed with the cattle and lowed as he ambled around the fresh fields, a   
Beautiful animal, colored like snow that no footprint has trodden   
And which no watery south wind has melted. His muscular neck bulged,   
Dewlaps hung down from his chin; his curved horns you might think had been hand carved,   
Perfect, more purely translucent than pearl. His unthreatening brow and   
Far from formidable eyes made his face appear tranquil. Agenor's   
Daughter was truly amazed that this beautiful bull did not seem to   
Manifest any hostility. Though he was gentle she trembled at first to   
Touch him, but soon she approached him, adorning his muzzle with flowers.   
Then he rejoiced as a lover and, while he looked forward to hoped for   
Pleasures, he slobbered all over her hands, and could hardly postpone the   
Joys that remained. So he frolicked and bounded about on the green grass,   
Laying his snowy-white flanks on the yellowish sands. As her fear was
Little by little diminished, he offered his chest for her virgin   
Hand to caress and his horns to be decked with fresh flowers. The royal   
Maiden, not knowing on whom she was sitting, was even so bold as   
Also to climb on the back of the bull. As the god very slowly   
Inched from the shore and the dry land he planted his spurious footprints   
Deep in the shallows. Thus swimming out farther, he carried his prey off   
Into the midst of the sea. Almost fainting with terror she glanced back,   
As she was carried away, at the shore left behind. As she gripped one   
Horn in her right hand while clutching the back of the beast with the other,   
Meanwhile her fluttering draperies billowed behind on the sea breeze.",Mythology and Folklore

Of the burning fires; the flood of flames was coming   
Nearer and nearer. “My father, let me take you   
Upon my shoulders and carry you with me.   
The burden will be easy. Whatever happens,   
You and I will experience it together,   
Peril or safety, whichever it will be.   
Little Iülus will come along beside me.   
My wife will follow behind us. And you, my servants,   
Listen to what I say: just as you leave   
The limits of the city there is a mound,   
And the vestiges of a deserted temple of Ceres,   
And a cypress tree that has been preserved alive   
For many years by the piety of our fathers.   
We will all meet there, though perhaps by different ways   
And, Father, you must carry in your arms   
The holy images of our household gods;   
I, coming so late from the fighting and the carnage   
Cannot presume to touch them until I have washed   
Myself in running water.” Thus I spoke.   

I take up the tawny pelt of a lion and   
Cover my neck and my broad shoulders with it,   
And bowing down, I accept the weight of my father;   
Iülus puts his hand in mine and goes   
Along beside me, trying to match my steps   
As best he can, trying his best to keep up.   
My wife follows behind us, a little way back.   
So we all set out together, making our way   
Among the shadows, and I, who only just   
A little while ago had faced, undaunted,   
Showers of arrows and swarms of enemy Greeks,   
Am frightened by every slightest change in the air   
And startled by every slightest sound I hear,   
Fearful for whom I walk with and whom I carry.
And just as I had almost come to the gates   
And thought that I had almost gotten us free,   
I thought I heard the sound of many feet,   
And my father, peering intently into the shadows,   
Cries out to me, “Get away, get away, my son,   
My son, they are coming! I see their shining shields,   
I see the glow of their weapons in the dark!”   
I am alarmed, and I don’t know what happened   
But some power hostile to me distracts my wits   
And I am confused, and I lead us away by ways   
That I don’t know, and off the familiar streets   
That together we are following, and so,   
O God! some fate has taken away my wife,   
Creüsa, my wife, away from me. What happened?   
Did she wander from the way that we were going?   
Did she fall back, having to rest some place   
Back there, and so we left her? I did not know.   
I never saw her again, and as we went,   
I never turned to look behind, and never   
Thought of her until we reached the mound   
And Ceres’ ancient place. When all of us,   
At last, had gotten there, we all were there,   
But she had vanished and she wasn’t there.   
Gone from her people, gone from her child, and her husband.   

What men or gods in my frenzy did I not   
Cry out against? What worse sight had I seen?   
I left Ascanius and Anchises and   
The household gods in the care of my companions   
And I found a secluded place deep in a valley   
For them to hide, and I myself took up   
My shining weapons and sought the city again,   
Determined, no matter what, to look for my   
Creüsa everywhere in Troy. I find   
My way along the walls and to, and through,   
The shadowed gate I’d left the city by;   
Carefully, step by unseen step, in the dark,   
Backwards the way I came I make my way;   
Everywhere as I go fills me with terror;   
The very silence around me fills me with terror.   
I make my way to my home in case, in case,   
She’s gone back there. The Greeks had invaded the house   
And set it on fire, and through the house the fire   
Rolled up on the surge of the wind to the very roof,   
And the flames tower high above the burning house   
And the heat of the burning pours up into the sky.   
And so I go on, and once again I see   
The palace of Priam, and the citadel,   
And in the empty courtyard of Juno’s shrine   
There’s Phoenix and dire Ulysses, guarding the treasures   
Taken from everywhere from the shrines that the Greeks   
Had set fire to; the golden bowls, the holy   
Altar-tables, the stolen holy vestments;   
Boys and trembling matrons stand around . . .   
I wander in the streets, in my desperation   
Calling out her name, Creüsa, Creüsa,   
Calling Creüsa, over and over again.   
And as I went among the ruined buildings   
And through the streets of the ruined city, lo,   
Suddenly there rose before my eyes   
The strangely magnified image of my wife.   
I was stupefied; my hair stood on end; my voice   
Got caught in my throat. Then she spoke to me and said   
Words that altered everything for me:   
“Beloved husband, what use is it for you   
To persist in this insanity of grief.   
What has happened here has happened not without   
The will of the gods. The high lord of Olympus   
Does not permit Creüsa to go with you   
To be with you on your journey where you are going.
Long exile will be yours, ploughing across   
Vast seas until you come to Hesperia,   
Where Lydian Tiber gently flows between   
Rich husbanded fields and where you will be happy,   
A king, and wedded to a royal wife.   
Give up your weeping now for your Creüsa;   
I, a Dardan woman and the spouse   
Of divine Venus’s son, will never see   
The scornful households of the Myrmidons   
Or the Dolopians, and never have to be   
A scullion slave in service to some Greek matron.   
The Mighty Mother keeps me on these shores.   
Farewell and may your care protect and cherish   
Your child and mine.” And having spoken thus,   
The image of her receded into air,   
Leaving me weeping, with so much still to say.   
Three times I tried to embrace her and to hold her;   
Three times the image, clasped in vain, escaped   
As if it were a breeze or on the wings   
Of a vanishing dream.   
                               And so, the night being over,   
I returned to my companions where they were.   
When I got there I was amazed to see   
How many others, women and men, had come,   
Wretched survivors of the fall of the city,   
To join us in the exile and the journey,   
A heartbreaking company, come from everywhere,   
Ready in their hearts and with their fortunes,   
To follow me wherever I was going.   
And now the morning star was rising over   
The highest ridges of Ida, bringing in   
The day that was beginning; the Danaans held   
The city behind the gates that they had locked.   
There was no hope of further help. And so   
I acknowledged this, and taking up the burden   
Of my father once again, I sought the hills.",Mythology and Folklore

He is the one who treads on hair.   
This big animal prowling   
was Nuing-kuiten.”   

He used to travel by night—
he did not want to be seen   
for people might shoot at him   
and he might maul someone.   
At night he could go unseen,   
after other lion sorcerers   
who slink into our dwellings   
and drag out men.   

The sorcerer lived with us   
hunting in a lion’s form   
until an ox fell prey to him.   
Then the Boers rode out   
and shot my father’s friend,   
but he fought those people off   
and came home to tell father   
how Boers had wounded him.   

He thought father did not know   
he was wounded in his lion form.   
Soon he would have to go   
for he lay in extreme pain.   
If only he could take father   
and teach him his magic and songs,   
father would walk in his craft,   
sing his songs, and remember him.
He died, and my father sang:   

“Men broke the string for me   
and made my dwelling like this.   
Men broke the string for me   
and now   
my dwelling is strange to me.   

My dwelling stands empty   
because the string has broken,   
and now   
my dwelling is a hardship for me.”   ",Mythology and Folklore
406,Fairy-tale Logic,"Fairy tales are full of impossible tasks:
Gather the chin hairs of a man-eating goat,
Or cross a sulphuric lake in a leaky boat,
Select the prince from a row of identical masks,
Tiptoe up to a dragon where it basks
And snatch its bone; count dust specks, mote by mote,
Or learn the phone directory by rote.
Always it’s impossible what someone asks—

You have to fight magic with magic. You have to believe
That you have something impossible up your sleeve,
The language of snakes, perhaps, an invisible cloak,
An army of ants at your beck, or a lethal joke,
The will to do whatever must be done:
Marry a monster. Hand over your firstborn son.",Mythology and Folklore

Were scary, it's true, but probably normal;
A house accepting new patterns of weight
With protest, the way no conviction goes gently.
We laughed a little, and called it ""our spirit.""

Later that night, when the power conked out
And the kids were crying, the ghost got a name,
""Daniel,"" and a history of whispered exploits,
All of them harmless, like nursery rhymes,
Or like the little fibs we tell ourselves
To explain why this or that has led to suffering.

Pretty soon, we were using him for everything.
When the Christmas tree fell, it was ""Daniel"";
When my wife lost her ring, it was ""Daniel"";
When the kids forgot to feed the goldfish
And it turned up dead, its eyes silvered over
Like water shadowed under sheets of ice,

Well, that became Daniel too, which was curious;
And pauses me now as I make the long walk
Down the hall to the bathroom in darkness,
And hear, in soft concert, the sound of my footfalls
Answered at once by my children's voices

Still calling to Daniel behind their door.",Mythology and Folklore

nine knife mountains and nine oil pans from hell?
Deep-fried ghosts are the sweetest the crispiest the most intelligent
even in burned rims, and taste even better with soybean drinks.

like Oedipus’s crutch.
Collapsed in the steamer, he squeaks out a sweet smell
of duck soup from his soul — quack, quack.

413,From “Case Comparison”,"How do I compare the costs
Of leaving one system
Of cooperation
For another
System of cooperation?
How do I loosen the tongue
Enough to inhabit
The temple incognito?
What are the people to me
Until I condense my hesitations
And drink in stillness with
The rest of us, slightly drunk
But pacing moderately
Around the dew, dropped
To the knees at a tepid hour?
Cooperation is free, or is it
So? A refugee has no terms
Of comparison. Who really is
Aggrieved is a real fugitive
To freedom. The only enemies
Of freedom are border agents
And those dozing on one side
Of the other. The border condition
Realizes the personality.
That is why it has to be
Negotiated again in public
Houses. I tried to be loved
And everyone else failed me.
The dew is a corrosive.
It’s only obvious once
The horizon tempers
The topography again.
And this is so only when
Earthlight can be confined
By the foreground.
Allegorists are not agents
Now so much as internet vernaculars
We all get our chance to innovate.
Nations cannot be explained
Otherwise. Someone, we,
Made up the whole thing.
I want us to think we were
Liars then but are dying to
Finally grow up, no longer
Following fictions. But
Perfectly flush corroborating
Rehearsals.
The students can always
Have the data
They deserve.
What is oligarchy?
They call it up
And it clicks.
(Hear the disconsolate
fizz of epiphany
pitched out of library windows
and welfare field office exits.)
Everything can be
Said to have
Occurred. But do
They describe themselves
As belated or latent?
The reveal is just a mild
Turning in
Any case.
The air in winter
Is best for your device.
Cordon it around your
Device’s appetite.
Or there will be
A disaster
For the recollection,
Proof by perdurable
Association. (Check
the custom, or costume,
that to learn is
a bargain first fixed
in the recognition of ignorance
for which the learned refuse
to serve as models.)
Students delay excitement
Just long enough
And then they know.
You are a student
By profession.
If you insist
You deserve
A livelihood
You will be
Persecuted
For this
And that is
What has become
Of forensics.
That is the
Rootless fact.
Its reason is
Untraceable, so
Its stolid justice proffers
Souls for history’s
Paltry set of names
Of strangers. To
Assimilate novelty
Is then to obtain inventory.
What will you do
With it all?
Won’t you enjoy
The leverage it provides
So as to insist
On more?
It is not data
But esteem.
That is the remaining
Root system,
That nothing will
Have to be
Enough.",Mythology and Folklore

415,Akechi’s Wife,"On one occasion Yūgen of Ise Province was offering to share, for a night or two, the comforts of his home with me when a distant, bemused expression came over his face as though at the recollection of a joke told him earlier that day; then, to a degree I would not have thought possible in one whose normal manner was so formal, that studiedly dour professorial expression gave way for an instant to one that positively beamed, illuminated from within by the sound of a beloved voice. So worn out, not even sure I was on the right road, I forgot myself awhile watching in weary amazement as his wife came and went, the two of them giving the impression of having long perfected some grave and complex dance known only to them, one of accord and the affection of two people moving hand-in-hand in the same direction, both possessed by desire while knowing themselves to be the source of that desire. But I am so tired, I heard my own voice say, one of them, that startlingly cruel, intrusive voice I hate, darkening everything, how sick I am of listening to it, and of having to go on! But after some time had passed once again I forgot all about it as I sat there, the witness of this marvel that brought peace to my heart or, perhaps, a hidden joy of my own, one I had so long considered extinct. When Yūgen fell on hard times and was dragged down into the most humiliating poverty, his wife made up her mind one day to have her long beautiful hair cut short so that she could sell it and he could afford to invite all their friends to an evening of laughter and drinking, renga competitions, and the conversation of those who have known one another for a long time, the kind look and humorous word that make it seem possible to live again. I think of her sometimes.
Moon, come down and
come alone. I have to tell you all
about Akechi’s wife.

423,Night Nurse,"This night nurse is different.
She walks into my room and does not turn the light on.
She thinks I am sleeping.
I have just barely opened my left eye,
am looking through the slightest slit,
as moonlight exposes the room
for what it really is — a collection
of surfaces; lines and planes, mostly.
The night nurse puts a foot up on the radiator
and braces her clipboard on her knee
as she appears to take down a few notes.
I imagine she is working on a sonnet,
and that her ankle looks like polished walnut.
You imagine she is working on a crossword,
and that her feet are killing her.
The slightest slit is like an old gate
at a Japanese tea garden at night,
in the rain, that is supposed to be closed,
that is supposed to be locked.

“Incorrectly.” But no one has asked you.",Mythology and Folklore
424,A Tale Told by Atheneus (Venus Callipygus),"Two sisters of ancient Greece both laid claim
To the finest, fairest rear of their time.
Which tail forged ahead? Which bottom’s true fame
Topped? Which back was in front, which terce most prime?
A judge chose the elder girl’s back matter;
Her finish was more fine and far matter.
She got the prize, and his heart; soon they wed.
“But the younger’s sitter’s not a smatter
Less meet; I’ll marry her,” his brother said.
It went so well, their joys were so perfected,
That after them a temple was erected
In honor of  Venus Callipygus.
No other church — though I don’t know its rite —
Could so, from head to epididymis,
Move me with deep devotion to its site.

425,The Ships of Theseus,"The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians    ...    for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.
— Plutarch, Vita Thesel
The answer of course is that the ship
doesn’t exist, that “ship”
is an abstraction, a conception,
an imaginary tarp thrown
across the garden of the real.
The answer is that the cheap
peasantry of things toils all day
in the kingdom of  language,
every ship like a casket
of words: bulkhead, transom,
mast steps. The answer
is to wake again to the banality
of things, to wade toward
the light inside the plasma
of ideas. But each plank
is woven from your mother’s
hair. The blade of each oar
contains the shadow of
a horse. The answer
is that the self is the glue between
the boards, the cartilage
that holds a world together,
that self is the wax in
the stenographer’s ears,
that there is nothing the mind
won’t sacrifice, each item
another goat tossed into
the lava of our needs.
The answer is that this is just
another poem about divorce,
about untombing the mattress
from the sofa, your body
laid out on the bones of the
double-jointed frame, about
separation, rebuilding, about
your daughter’s missing
teeth. Each time you visit
now you find her partially
replaced, more sturdily
jointed, the weathered joists
of   her childhood being stripped
away. New voice. New hair.
The answer is to stand there
redrawing the constellation
of   the word daughter in
your brain while she tries
to understand exactly who
you are, and breathes out
girl after girl into the entry-
way, a fog of   strangers that
almost evaporates when
you say each other’s
names. Almost, but not quite.

He wants my soul.
And finally giving in, I give him my gleaming soul
And as he eats my gleaming soul, I am one with him

428,Boardinghouse with No Visible Address,"So, I thought,
as the door was unlocked
and the landlord disappeared (no,

and I got to examine the room
unobserved. There
it stood
in its gray corner:
the narrow bed, sheets
the color of old aspirin.

somewhere inside me
already, or
was just about to.
Is there a choice?

even a difference? Familiar,

I had often wondered
where I would find it, and
what it would look like.
Don’t you?
It was so awful
I couldn’t speak. Then
maybe you ought to lie down for a minute, I heard myself
thinking. I mean
if  you are having that much trouble
functioning. And when
was the last time
with genuine sorrow
and longing to change
you got on your knees?
I could get some work done
here, I shrugged;
I had done it before.
I would work without cease.
Oh, I would stay awake
if only from horror
at the thought of waking
up here. Ma,
a voice spoke from the darkness
in the back seat where
a long thin man lay,
arms crossed
on his chest,
while they cruised slowly up and down
straining to make out the numbers
over unlighted doors,
the midnight doctor’s;
in his hurt mind
he was already merging
with a black Mississippi
of mercy, the sweat pouring off him
as though he’d been doused
with a bucket of ice water
as he lay sleeping. “I saw the light,”
they kept screaming. “Do
I saw the light!”
Ma — there ain’t no light
I don’t see no light.

hangs with his head down.
In height, he is a cloud, the size
of a lost faith
in returning home.

So should I, a pauper sitting
by a stranger’s door, declare: I’m Odysseus,
and I’m back. Should I say:
I’m recognized. After the mourning songs
tears are still rolling down my face. I have been
summoned to clothe the past
in the shining ice.

The twilight pushes a heavy box of reflection
out of the windows
and thumbs through a pale face
as if it were a stack of letters lying in a vacuum,
written by an unfamiliar hand. 
You are in Ithaca, but you are not yet home.

The soul goes home the way of flesh,
clothed in white rags,

upon arrival: I recognize

vapor of window reflections
harden not in the shining of the ice
that has come out of a secret thought,
but from a permanent neighboring frame,
which has embraced life into its shores of death,
where my steps on the sand
are uneven and filled with water.

Old rags are stronger than old life.
Night, like dead water, sows together
the tattered contours of the past. 
A stranger’s death is a seed of your homeland,
sprouting from the graveyard statues,
from the clouds, forever still.

Feminine words are followed
by a circle with two dots over.
They call it the tied circle,
knotted with wishes
which come true only when forgotten
or replaced by the wishes of others.

In the town of tied wishes,
people feel great anticipation
because a stranger will arrive
today in her feminine sign.
Someone says he saw her
two dots glittering,
refuting another’s vision
of a cat’s eyes hunting in darkness.
So scary, he says, how the moon
hides in her red circle.

Everyone is busy today
listing wishes on pieces
of paper they’ll give to the wind.
When the stranger finds them
on her way, she’ll collect them
and garland them to her circle,
tossing some old wishes
to make space for the new.
They say the dropped ones
will come true.

The stranger’s lateness
worries the waiting.
Someone says she’s searching
for a word to complete
a special sentence,
the gift she’ll bring to town.

Another wonders if she seeks
a verb or a noun,
offering to find her.
A third warns that the stranger
may turn him into a flower
with one touch, blooming
for only a moment,
before a withering death,
and her circle throbs with songs
causing sadness and elation,
and something so obscure
no one has a name for it.
Will she complete a verb
or a noun phrase — or give a solo,
a word complete on its own?
They wonder.

When they finally hear footsteps,
they know the stranger must be near.
Make sure the gate is open,
they remind one another.
They hear clinking —

448,Civitas,"Acts of love have
material effects. For a woman

tending the sacred fire, these include
the risk of becoming

an extinguisher
of flames essential

to civic life. It is a burden
to put out

what others hold as central
to faith in coherence. Acts of faith

have material effects — a Vestal
Virgin touched by encounter

must be buried alive,
a beautiful metaphor

for shame itself, which squirms
even under all that dirt. Thus, the dead

learn too late
that devotion should be

unidirectional, a straight line
from here to suffocation. Love must not

bleed at the edges, must not meet
others in the banal spaces

of civic life. It is a burden
to personify. If Vesta’s hearth is the site

of the sacred, its material effects
are destruction: burning, consumption,

constant hunger
for more wood. Acts

of destruction have
fantasmatic effects. For a body

surviving encounter, these include
civic life, shame;

the risk of being
a proxy — tender

of the hearth belonging
to the public, by way

of the goddess, who embodies a dream

agape. Our teeth:         little needles to stitch a factory of
everything made in China.      You ask: Are you hungry?
Hunger eats through the air like ozone. You ask: What
does it mean to be rootless? Roots are good to use as
toothpicks. You: How can you wake in the middle of
a life? We shut and open our eyes like the sun shining
on tossed pennies in a forgotten well. Bald copper,
blood. Yu choy bolts                  into roses down here.
While you were sleeping, we woke to the old leaves
of  your backyard shed and ate that and one of your
lost flip-flops too. In a future life, we saw rats overtake

at all who passed those vampires and angels you encountered, can you state for the record the moan you heard the ghosts emit across the nation-state,,, wuaahh buu,,, did you perform three miracles for a virile hag a witch with universes for eyes and did you request in barter a single boon his location or did you unlock his location using a skeleton, are we all a line assembled from white keys of death and is this song the sonata we hear when we press those keys, was your tool to search for him a wishbone, did you slice the wishbone from the breast of a monstrous old god, who was the god, what was his username, was it one of the ghost-giants you fled from terrified that he may have glimpsed even a shred of you, was it the famished god who grabs small ghosts to its mouth and slurps down their marrow, was it a devourer whose fingerprints leak out red tears in hysterical shame, was it Francisco Pizarro, was it King Leopold, did you see Joe Arpaio levitating each leg borne aloft by flying police cars, did you see Winston Churchill that infant-faced faminist turning loose new Emergencies, was it Andrew Jackson mounting a scorpion across that moist trail this pilgrimage for creating new ghosts, did the ghosts cry out wwuu wah,,,,,,,,, how did you kill the god, is revolutionary politics the name for deicide,, a wa wa,,,, is the translation for that moan “god grief!” did you slay the god with smallpox or pistols, hemlock or Maxim, London debt or land grants or fantasies or plague blankets or kryptonite, was it patricide, did you pry your fingers into his rib cage, did you hold the bone’s moist handles up into the sky and poke that plump cloud with your dowsing rod, did the stick sniff out your father from this city of ghosts until this wet rod twitched, until the witching stick tugged you through hell’s alleyways, until you arrived here at this modest house, what category of building is the house that contains your father, until you found a prison, until you found a shadowless space where he waited underneath a star, is death the story of until, is death the story you came to untell, did the light emit a silence like hssssssshs, this light the star wept—was it a message from the past strewn across black heaven, an emergency beacon from a plague universe calling help help from masters and money, what sound do you hear arrayed against you (here the ghost chorus leaps and screams keke keke!), did the star halt above that house like a police chopper spotlight, basking its blue heat on your skin, was this when the star’s strange beams obliterated your shadow, did you cry no please my shadow is all I have here, did you say without my shadow I am a ghost, without my shadow I have no history, how did you feel when the star cried and wailed down its weep-light in fragile pink lineaments, did you see the star throned above where your father may be waiting, is your father the king who sleeps in a cave beneath the city or does his life continue in this mute house, is he washing the dishes as we speak, is he talking on the phone in that loud way of his, is he watching a K-Drama while eating 牛 肉 麵, did he clip the soup’s recipe from that most authentic of sources Gourmet magazine, had you bought him the subscription for his birthday and was his reply to you months later, “Fine, these French can cook but take away butter and they don’t know how to do anything,” (hahahahaha say the ghosts) was that many years ago now in fact probably a decade, did you just glance down at your wristwatch to show how many days are left in your very own life, do the manic watch hands ratchet around like helicopter blades chuh chuh chuh, were you given this watch from your future self that renegade timelord, do you have the time, is time something one can possess or does it soar away from us on outspread wings, but doesn’t Dōgen say that time does not fly since it does not exist outside of us, is it impossible to exist outside the underworld, did you open the front door to the house and see the living room from your childhood, the white Naugahyde couch preserving the dark halo that he cast when he dozed off during his hair dye, the cubic light of a TV luminous solely from VHF, and framed by the window: a blue Honda, car of his youth!,,, these nostalgic recreations do they make you wonder if you had somehow time traveled to a coordinate outside of the underworld, traveled to the past, or would it be more accurate to say that we are already inside the underworld, that the apocalypse is not a spectacle but what elapses as we speak, what does it mean to speak,, ha ha blah blah blah,,,, did you tour the house of memory saying nothing, did you find the doors to each room shut, all handles locked, is this how your waking

an evil god, did Andrew Jackson wink at you from the currency and bare his fangs hsss sa sa,,,,,,, was this when the five dollar bill singed you, did the sign of the apocalyptic populist ignite and

laugh and say on god’s intercom here is your shadow catch, did you fall through the hole in the carpet, did you land in one of the old sewers and in the distance see someone sleeping on a stone slab,

a sheet, did the woman tell you what she had seen and do you remember telling her “You have a terrible job—you must tell everyone that the one they love has died,” did you recognize her when you entered this place and saw the Recording Angel, is the occupation of that archivist of prayers: writer, did the sleeping figure roll back as though on an airport conveyer, do the walls of the cave inch closer to strangle you, is the underworld a prison since those who enter it have no right to return, who will rescue you, who will rescue you now that you have lathered yourself with cave, is it true that you have forgotten how to breathe, did you aspire to be as breathless as the ghosts who populate this place or did you just have a bad day, would you like to stop, would you like to stop and catch your breath huh huhh huh, did you simultaneously call your expression narcissism and your restraint self-loathing, doubly self-damning, have you been given permission to forgive yourself, shall you ask the mirror Uncle what ails thee, what about your dowsing rod, will you wish for water, wish for air, witch for heir, did you tap your bone wand to the gray rocks repressing you, did the earth and its baroque caverns transpire into the simple night about you, did you look down through the wind from a ship sailing dark heights, did you find the ship’s steadiness strange given that nothing supported you above sky and city, well is the air nothing, was it the Maya who said that soul was simply breath, is the soul nothing, what if you crept into the airship’s spacious caverns and saw not helium but a palace of flowers, what if the entire vessel had been borne up by the exhalations of flowers their breath tasting sweet into the air, what if this was the world, what if you lived on a

the market who had returned to Haiti the day before the earthquake, did he tell you what that taught him, was the lesson to quit his job and love his daughter and begin afresh, did he remind you that

yourself down in the airship’s aisles unsuspended by clouds and float in the silver air, buoyed by nothing so magical as resurrection, did you take a deep breath and accept an in-flight complimentary

464,The Government Lake,"          The way to the toy store was blocked by a fallen tree
in the road. There was a policeman directing traffic down a
side street. I asked him, “What happened?” He said, “Lightning
in the night.” I took the turn and drove down the street
looking for a way to turn back. Other streets were blocked by
fallen trees, and I couldn’t find a way back to the toy store.
I kept driving and soon I was on the outskirts of town. I
got on a highway and drove, soon forgetting the toy store and
what I was supposed to get there. I drove on as if I was hypno-
tized, not noticing the signs for turnoffs. I must have driven
a couple of hours before I woke up, then I took the next exit
and had no idea where I was. I drove down a straight tree-lined
lane with farm houses on either side. There was a lake at the
end of the lane. I pulled over and parked. I got out and
started walking. There were several docks along the shore.
I walked out on one and watched the ducks swimming and diving.
There was something bobbing in the middle of the lake. I stared
at it for a long time before I realized it was a man’s head.
Then, a moment later, it was a coconut. No, it was an old tire
floating right side up. I gave up and started following the
ducks. They would suddenly fly up and circle the lake and
come down and splash land again. It was quite entertaining.
A man walked up behind me and said, “This government lake is
off-limits to the public. You’ll have to leave.” I said,
“I didn’t know it was a government lake. Why should it be
off-limits?” He said, “I’m sorry. You’ll have to leave.”
“I don’t even know where I am,” I said. “You’ll still have
to leave,” he said. “What about that man out there?” I said,
pointing to the tire. “He’s dead,” he said. “No, he’s not.
I just saw him move his arm,” I said. He removed his pistol from
his holster and fired a shot. “Now he’s dead,” he said.",Mythology and Folklore

      Lord Teucer’s eye/Prince Hector’s throat.
But God would not. The bowstring snaps.   



      Outside God’s inner court.   
Queen Hera and Athena still in line.   
Hera so angry she can hardly speak.   
      A voice:   
“The Wife, the Daughter.”   
“You go. His face will make me   
    heave.”   



“Serene and Dignified Grandee.”   
“Papa to you.”   

“Papa”—His hand—   
“I know you do not want the Holy Family   
    visiting the plain.   
But some of us would like to help the Greeks.   
They lost their champion she.   
    Thousands of them have died. Now they are in retreat.   
    Please look.”
      
      The plain.   

“You will come back the moment that I call?”   
“Of course, Papa.”   
“Then . . . yes. Encourage Greece.   
But voices only.   
    Words. Shouts. That sort of thing. A move—and home you come.”   
“Of course, Papa.”   

      The plain.   

      Lord Teucer’s archers hidden in its grass.   

    Chylábborak, Lord Hector’s brother-in-law, to his blue plumes:
“Move!”   
“Move!”   
      And on their flanks, between the sea and snow,   
Led by Teléspiax’ silver yard   
All Ilium’s masks   

“Down came their points. Out came their battle cry.   
And our cool Mr 5 x 5 called: ‘Up.’ And up we got   
And sent our arrows into them,   
That made them pirouette,   
Topple back down the rise, leaving their dead   
For some of us to strip, and some, the most,   
To pause, to point, to plant, a third, a fourth   
Volley into their naked backs. Pure joy!”   



      Chylábborak,   
Holding his ground:   
“Centre on me.   
More die in broken than in standing ranks.   
Apollo! Aphrodité! Our gods are here!   
You taste the air, you taste their breath!   
The Greek fleet, ours, by dark!”   

      Then he is ringed.   

      See an imperial pig harassed by dogs.   
      How, like a masterchef his crêpes,   
      He tosses them; and on their way back down   
      Eviscerates, then flips them back into the pack.   
Likewise Chylábborak the Greeks who rushed.   

      Hector has seen it. As—   
Beneath the blue, the miles of empty air,   
Him just one glitter in that glittering   mass—   
The hosts begin to merge.   



      Fine dust clouds mixed with beams of light.   
The Prince, down from his plate.   
Either sides’ arrows whingeing by:   
“Cover my back.”   
Finding a gap   
Dismissing blows as gales do slates,   
Then at a run, leaping into the ring,   
Taking Chylábborak’s hand:   
“If you don’t mind?”   



      Agamemnon:   
“Our time has come. God keeps his word.   
Fight now as you have never fought.   
We will be at Troy’s gates by dusk,   
Through them by dark,   
By dawn, across our oars,   
As we begin our journey home,   
Watching the windmills on its Wall   
Turn their sails in flames.”   



    Heaven. The Wife. The Daughter.   

    Hands release black lacquer clasps inlaid with particles of gold.   
Silk sheaths—with crashing waves and fishscales woven on a   
            navy ground—   
Flow on the pavement.   

      Hands take their hands   

      While other hands supply   

      Warwear,   

      Their car,   

      And put the reins into Athena’s hands.   



“. . . Troy’s gates by dusk,   
      Through them by dark . . .”   



      The Hours, the undeniable,   
Open the gates of Paradise.   

      Beyond   

      The wastes of space.   

      Before   

      The blue.   

      Below   

      Now near   

      The sea, the snow.   



      All time experts in hand-to-hand action—   
Friecourt, Okinawa, Stalingrad West—   
Could not believe the battle would gain.   
But it did.   

      Chylábborak’s ring is ringed. And then no ring at all.   
Some Trojans raise their hands in prayer;   
      Some Panachéans shout for joy and wait to drag the corpses off.


      Lutie, alone, the reins in one, his other hand   
Hacking away the hands that grab his chariot’s bodywork,   
Rearing his horses, Starlight and Bertie, through,   
      To,   
      Yes,   
      Chylábborak up; rescued;   
Prince Hector covering. Then:   

“Zoo-born wolf! Front for a family of thieves!”   
Lord Diomed, on foot, with Sethynos.   
      My Lutie answering:   
“Be proud Prince Hector is your Fate.”   
(Which will be so,   
Though Lutie will not see it.)   
      Chylábborak and Hector do not want to disappoint this oily pair:   
“Here come the Sisters Karamazof, Spark,”   
Chylábborak said. “Let’s send them home in halves.”   
And jumped back down.   



      Around the tower, 1000 Greeks, 1000 Ilians, amid their swirl,   
His green hair dressed in braids, each braid   
Tipped with a little silver bell, note   
Nyro of Simi—the handsomest of all the Greeks, save A.   
                  The trouble was, he had no fight. He dashed from fight to fight,
Struck a quick blow, then dashed straight out again.   
Save that this time he caught,   
As Prince Aenéas caught his breath,   
That Prince’s eye; who blocked his dash,   
And as Lord Panda waved and walked away,   
Took his head off his spine with a backhand slice—   
Beautiful stuff . . . straight from the blade . . .   
      Still, as it was a special head,   
Mowgag, Aenéas’ minder—   
Bright as a box of rocks, but musical—   
Spiked it, then hoisted it, and twizzling the pole   
Beneath the blue, the miles of empty air,   
Marched to the chingaling of its tinklers,   
A knees high majorette   
Towards the Greeks, the tower.   



      A roar of wind across the battlefield.   

      A pause.   

      And then   

      Scattering light,   
The plain turned crystal where their glidepath stopped,   
The Queen of Heaven shrills: “Typhoid for Troy!”   
And through poor Nyro’s wobbling mouth   
Athena yells:   

“Slew of assiduous mediocrities!   
Meek Greeks!”   



      It is enough.   

      Centre-plain wide,   
Lit everywhere by rays of glorious light,   
They rushed their standards into Ilium,   
      Diomed (for once) swept forward;   
Converting shame to exaltation with his cry:   

“Never—to Helen’s gold without her self!   
      Never—to Helen’s self   
    without her gold!”   

      Mowgag well slain.   
Hewn through his teeth, his jaw slashed off,   
And Nyro’s head beside him in the grass.   

      When Nyro’s mother heard of this   
She shaved her head; she tore her frock; she went outside   
Ripping her fingernails through her cheeks:   
Then down her neck; her chest; her breasts;   
And bleeding to her waist ran round the shops,   
Sobbing:   
“God, kill Troy.   
Console me with its death.   
Revenge is all I have.   
My boy was kind. He had his life to live.   
I will not have the chance to dance in Hector’s blood,   
But let me hear some have before I die.”   

“I saw her running round.   
      I took the photograph.   
      It summed the situation up.   
      He was her son.   
      They put it out in colour. Right?   
      My picture went around the   
    world.”   



      Down the shaft of the shot in his short-staved bow   
      Lord Panda has been follow-spotting Diomed.   

      Between “her self ” / “her gold” he shoots.   
It hits. And as its barbs protrude through Dio’s back   
Aenéas hears Lord Panda shout:   
“He bleeds! The totem Greek! Right-shoulder-front!
How wise of Artemis to make   
Panda her matador! Her numero uno! Moi!”   

      Diomed hit,   
The heart went out of those who followed him   
And they fell back.   



    Shields all round   

Diomed on his knees   

Lifting his hands:   

“Sister and wife of God”   

As Sethynos breaks off the arrowhead   

“Eliminate my pain.”   

Settles his knee beneath his hero’s shoulderblades   

“Let me kill that oaf who claims my death”   

Bridges his nape with one hand   

“Before it comes with honour to my name.”   

    Then with his other hand   
In one long strong slow pull   
Drew the shank back, and out.   



    She heard his prayer.   

    Before their breathless eyes   
His blood ran back into the pout the shank had left,   
And to complete her miracle   
Lord Diomed rose up between them, stood in the air,   
Then hovered down onto his toes   
Brimming with homicidal joy,   
Imparting it to Greece.   

    Then Troy was driven back,   
Trampling the half-stripped still-masked carcasses   
Hatching the centre of the plain.   



      Aenéas / Panda.   
      

“Get him.”   

“Get him! I got him. He is dead. But there he is.”   

      And Diomed has spotted them.   

“Calm down,” Aenéas said. “Perhaps he is possessed.”   

“What god would visit him?”   

“So pray to yours—and try another shot.”   

“Huntress,” Lord Panda prays,   
      Bright-ankled   god of nets and lines,
      Of tangled mountains, ilex groves and dark cascades . . .”   

      But Artemis was bored with him   
And let him rise, still praying hard,   
Into the downflight of the javelin   
Diomed aired at Prince Aenéas.   

    Sunlit, it went through Panda’s lips, out through his neck, and then
Through Biblock’s neck.   
      And so they fell; the lord, face up; the friend, face down   
Gripping the blood-smeared barb between his teeth,   
Between the sea and snow.   

      Aenéas covers them.   

      Eyeing his plate   
—Technology you can enjoy—   
Diomed found, and threw, a stone   
As heavy as a cabbage made of lead,   
That hit, and split, Aenéas’ hip.   
Who went down on one knee   
And put his shield hand on the grass   
And with his other hand covered his eyes.   
Dido might have become a grandmother   
And Rome not had its day, except   
As Diomed came on to lop his top   
Aenéas’ mama, Aphrodité (dressed   
In grey silk lounge pyjamas piped with gold   
And snake-skin flip-flops) stepped   
Between him and the Greek.   
A glow came from her throat, and from her hair   
A fragrance that betokened the divine.   
Stooping, she kissed him better, as   
Queen Hera whispered: “Greek, cut that bitch.”   
And, Diomed, you did; nicking Love’s wrist.   



    Studying the ichor as   
It seeped across her pulse into her palm   
Our Lady of the Thong lifted her other hand   
Removed a baby cobra from her hair   
And dropped it, Diomed, onto your neck,   
And saw its bite release its bane into your blood.   
      Then nobody could say   
Who Diomed fought for, or for what he fought.   

      Rapt through the mass   
      Now shouting at the sky, now stomping on the plain,   
      He killed and killed and killed, Greek, Trojan, Greek,
Lord/less, shame/fame, both gone; and gone   
Loyalty nurtured in the face of death,   
The duty of revenge, the right to kill,   
To jeer, to strip, to gloat, to be the first   
To rally but the last to run, all gone—   
And gone, our Lady Aphrodité, giggling.   

      While everywhere,   

Driving your fellow Greeks   
    Back down the long incline that leads to the Scamánder’s ford,
Surely as when   
Lit from the dark part of the sky by sudden beams,   
A bitter wind   
Detonates line by line of waves against the shore.   

    No mind. Even as Teucer backed away   
He kept his eyes on you.   
“You feel the stress? You feel the fear?   
Behold your enemy! the Prince God loves!”   
    See   Teucer’s bow. Hear Teucer’s: “This time lucky.”   
    His—   
But this time it was not our Father, God,   
Who saved your life, my Prince.   
    As Agamemnon cried:   
“The ships are safe.   
Stand at the riverside’s far bank.”   
Teléspiax heard the rustle of Lord Teucer’s shot   
And stood between yourself and it.   

    His head was opened, egglike, at the back,   
Mucked with thick blood, blood trickling from his mouth.   
His last words were:   
“Prince, your trumpeter has lost his breath.”   

    “Our worst fear was his face would fade,”   
    Teléspiax’s father said.
“But it did not. We will remember it until we die.”   

    “Give his instrument to Hogem,” Hector said, and went—   
Lutie on reins—between the sea and snow,   
Throwing his chariots wide, Scamánderwards,   
As easily as others might a cloak.   



    Diomed among this traffic, on his own,   
Among his dead,   
Their pools of blood, their cut-off body-parts,   
Their cut-off heads,   
Ashamed as his head cleared   
To see Odysseus, Idomeneo, the Ajax—Big and Small—   
Whipping away downslope, shouting towards Odysseus:   
“Where are you going with your back to the battle?”   
Who shouted back, although he did not turn:   
“Look left!”   
And there was Lutie driving Hector onto him,   

Sure they would trample him, for sure   
Queen Hera’s human, Diomed,   
Would stand and die, except:   
“Arms up, young king—” Nestor, full tilt,   
Reins round his tummy, leaning out “—and   
Jump . . .” wrists locked “. . . You young are just . . .”   
Swinging him up onto the plate “. . . too much.”   

“With your permission, Da?”   
Nod. Drew. Then threw the chariot’s javelin   
As Lutie spun his wheels, and Hector threw—   
Those skewers trading brilliance as they passed—   
And missed—both vehicles slither-straightening,   
Regaining speed, close, close, then driven apart   
By empty cars careering off the incline,   
Or stationary cars, their horses cropping grass.   

“Daddy, go slow. Hector will say I   ran.”   
“But not the widows you have made.”   

    And slow   
    And low   
Cruising the blue above this mix   
Heaven’s Queen and Ringsight-eyed Athena   
Trumpeting down huge worms of sound   
As Hector’s car rereached king Nestor’s,   and:   
“What kept you, Prince?” Diomed offered as they came abreast:   
“You went for a refreshing towel?”   
And threw his axe, that toppled through the air, and, oh,   
Hector, my Hector, as you thought:   
“If Heaven helps me Heaven shows it loves the best,”   
Parted your Lutie’s mesh and smashed into his heart.   

    What did you say as God called you to death   
Dear Lutie?   

“King Prince, I leave you   driverless.”   

    And put the reins into his hands, and fled   
Into oblivion   

      As Hector with his other hand   
Held what his Lutie was, upright, face forwards, in between   
The chariot’s basket and himself,   
Shouting as he drove after them:   

“Loathsome Greek,   
Your loathsome hair, your loathsome blood,   
Your loathsome breath, your loathsome heart,   
Jump in your loathsome ships,   
I will come after you,   
Come over the Aegean after you,   
And find you though you hide inside   
Your loathsome father’s grave   
And with my bare hands twist your loathsome head   
Off your loathsome neck.”   

      There was a Greek called Themion.   
Mad about armour. If not armour, cars.   
Of course he went to Troy. And Troy   
Saw a stray spear transfix him as he drove.   
      Companionably, his horses galloped up   
On Starlight’s side, and muddled Starlight down,   
And Bertie down, and brought the Prince   
(Still holding Lutie) down, as all the world   
Hurried, as if by windheads, on towards   Scamánder’s ford.   


hether you reach it from the palisade   
Or through the trees that dot the incline’s last stretch
You hear Scamánder’s voice before you see   
What one may talk across on quiet days   
Its rippling sunspangled breadth   
Streaming across the bars of pebbly sand   
That form its ford   
—Though on the Fleet’s side deeper, darkly bright.   

      And here   
Tiptoeing from this bar to that,   
Settling the cloudy sunshine of her hair,   
Her towel retained by nothing save herself,   
The god of Tops and Thongs   
Our Lady Aphrodité came,   
Her eyes brimfull with tears.   



    Scamánder is astonished by his luck.   

“Beauty of Beauties, why are you weeping?”   
“I have been hurt, Scamánder.”   
“No . . .”   
“Humiliated.”   
“No . . .”   
“Me. A god. Just like yourself. Touched . .   .”   
“Touched!”   
“By a man.”   
“A man!”   
“A Greek.”   
“Death to all Greeks!”   
“He cut me!”   
“Sacrilege!   
. . . But where?”   
“I need your healing touch.”   
“How can I help you if you do not show me where?”   
“Moisten its lips and my wound will be healed.”   
“You must say where!”   
“Well . . .”   
    The towel has slipped an inch.   
“I am afraid you will be disappointed.”   
“Never.”   
“Are you sure?”   
“Yes!”   
“You will not criticize me?”   
“No!”   
    Her wrist upturned.   
    Out-turned.   
    Her opened palm.   
    Fanning the fingers of her other hand,   
Stroking his spangles with her fingertips.   
“Goddess, I love you.   
I have always loved you.   
Say that you love me. Even a little.   
I beg you. God grant it.”   
“I need your help, Scamánder.”   
“Take pity on me. Come into me.”   
“You have your nymphs.”   
“Bores! Bores!”   
“I might be nibbled by an eel!”   
“Death to all eels!”   
    The towel is down.   
“Step into me . . .   
I love your toes . . . please let me kiss your toes . . .   
Your little dinkum-inkum toes . . .”   
“No one has kissed them so nicely, Scamánder.”   
“And now your knees . . .”   
“You tickle me . . .”   
“And now your thighs!”   
“Oh, oh, go on . . .”   
“And now your bum!   
    Your Holy Bum! Your Sacred Bum!   
    The Bum of Paradise!”   
“Oh, my Scamánder, I must have your help . . .”   
“Anything!”   
    The towel goes curling off,   
And as she floated on his stream   
Our Lady Aphrodité said:   
“At any moment now the Greeks will reach your   
         Troy-side bank . . .”   

    Recall those sequences   
    When horsemen ride out of the trees and down into a   stream   
Somewhere in Kansas or Missouri, say.   
    So—save they were   thousands—Greece   
Into Scamánder’s ford.   



    Coming downstream,   
A smallish wave   

    That passes   

    But   

    Scamánder’s flow does not relapse.   

    Indeed   

    Almost without a sound   
Its murmuring radiance rose   
Into a dark, torrential surge,   
Clouded with boulders, crammed with trees, as clamorous   
         as if it were a sea,   
That lifted Greece, then pulled Greece down,   
Cars gone, masks gone, gone under, reappearing, gone:   

“Onto your knees! Praise Hector for this flood!   
The Prince God loves!” Prince Hector claims   
As he comes through the trees.   

    They do.   
Then up and run, run, thousands of them,   
To hold those Greeks who got back out   
Under until their bubbles stopped; while those swept off   
Turned somersaults amid Scamánder’s undertow.   



    The flat—   

    1000 yards of it between the river and the palisade.   

    The King:   

“The Lord has not abandoned us.   
To cross will be as bad for them.”   



    But it was not to be as bad for them.   

    Indeed,   
As Hector drove towards Scamánder’s brink,   
And as—their banners rising one by one,   
One after one and then another one—   
He and all Ilium began to enter it,   
    The river reassumed its softly-spoken, smooth, sunspangled way.   

    And Agamemnon cried:   

“God, what are You for?   
What use are You to me?”   

    As Hector cries:   

“Two miracles!   
Your Prince is close to God!”   

    And Hera to Athena:   

“Fog?”   

    And fog came down.   

    And most of Greece got out.   



    Troy holding hands midstream.   
An army peering through its masks.   



    Miss Tops and Thongs to God:   

“Your Hera has . . .”   

    And with a wish He turned the fog to light   

    And with a word He called them back to Heaven.   



    Sky.   
    Snow.   
    The 1000 yards.   
    The palisade.   

    Hector:   
“I am your Prince.   
My name means He-Who-Holds.   
Troy. And the plain. And now the ships.   
    For Troy!” his battle cry,   
Rising into a common cry, that cry   
Into a clamour, and that clamour to   
Bayings of hatred.   

    800 yards.   

    The Child:   
“We are the Greeks. We fight to win. If one is lost,   
Close his eyes, step over him, and kill his enemy.”   

    800 yards.   

    The Greeks are tiring.   
    Nestor is on his knees:   

“God of all Gods, Most Holy and Most High,
      If Greece has ever sacrificed fresh blood to you,
      Protect our ships.”   



    Heaven.   
Soft music. Summertime. Queen Hera and Athena? Yes . . .   

    Some lesser gods   
Observing their approach, approach,   
Salaam, and then   
Lead them—   
Now both in black wraparound tops—   
To God:   

“Darling Daddy, here we are.”   
“And” (Hera) “here we stay   
Until you stop that worthless Hector killing Greeks.”   
    Up steps Love.   
    Hera: “Why is she wearing a tent?”   
    Love: “Father, see this.” (Her wrist.)   
“Human strikes god! Communism! The end of everything!”   

“Darlings,” He said,   
“You know that being a god means being blamed.   
Do this—no good. Do that—the same. The answer is:   
Avoid humanity.   
    Remember—I am God.   
I see the bigger picture.”   

“And I am Hera, Heaven’s Queen,   
Greece worships me.”   

“Stuff Greece,” Love said.   
“Your blubber-bummed wife with her gobstopper nipples   
Hates Troy because Troy’s Paris put her last   
When we stripped off for him.   
    As for the Ithacan boat-boy’s undercurved preceptatrix,   
She hates Troy because my statue stands on its acropolis.”   

      Hera: “The cities’ whores were taxed to pay for it.”   
      Love (Dropping onto her knees before Himself):   
“Please . . . stop them harming Troy. The greatest city   
                in the world.”   

      While Hera and Athena sang:   

“Cleavage! Cleavage!   
      Queen of the Foaming Hole.   
      Mammoth or man or midge   
      She sucks from pole to pole.”   

      And God has had enough of it.   

      Lifting His scales He said:   

“Hector will have his day of victory.”   
Then crashed them to the ground.   



      700 yards.   

      The palisade.   

      Its gate.   

      Late sunlight on gilt beaks.   

“There’s no escape from Troy.”   
“Or from the plain at Troy.”   

      Begging for ransom, Trojan Hoti,   
His arms around King Menelaos’ knees.   

      King Agamemnon: “Off.”   

      Then he punched Hoti in the face.   
Then punched him in the face again.   
And then again. And when he fell   
King Agamemnon kicked him in the groin.   
Kicking him in the groin with so much force   
It took a step to follow up each kick.   
Then pulled him up,   
Then dragged him by his hair   
This way and that,   
Then left him, calling:   
“Finish him off.”   
And someone did.   



“I was sixteen. I said: ‘Where is Achilles?’   
Hard as it is to share another’s troubles when your own are pressing   
Great Ajax took my hands in his and said:   
‘He loves us. He is with us. He will come.’”   

      But he did not.   

      Then Ajax to himself:   
“Dear Lord, you made me straight.   
Give me the strength to last till dark.”   

      The Prince: “I get past   everything I see.   
Their war is lost.”   

      It was.   

      Aenéas, Ábassee, Sarpédon, Gray,   
Calling to one another down the line.   
      Then, with a mighty wall of sound,   
As if a slope of stones   
Rolled down into a lake of broken glass   
We ran at them.   



    And now the light of evening has begun   
To shawl across the plain:   
Blue gray, gold gray, blue gold,   
Translucent nothingnesses   
Readying our space,   
Within the deep, unchanging sea of space,   
For Hesper’s entrance, and the silver wrap.   

    Covered with blood, mostly their own,   
Loyal to death, reckoning to die   
Odysseus, Ajax, Diomed,   
Idomeneo, Nestor, Menelaos   
And the King:   

“Do not die because others have died.”   
“Do not show them the palms of your hands.”   

“Achil!”   
“Achil!”   
“If he won’t help us, Heaven help us.”   

“Stand still and fight.”   
“Feel shame in one another’s eyes.”   
“I curse you, God. You are a liar, God.   
Troy will be yours by dark—immortal lies.”   
“Home!”   
“Home!”   
“There’s no such place.”   
“You can’t launch burning ships.”   
“More men survive if no one runs.”   

    But that is what Greece did.   

    Dropping their wounded,   
Throwing down their dead,   
Their shields, their spears, their swords,   
They ran.   

    Leaving their heroes tattered, filthy, torn   

    And ran   

    And ran   

    Above their cries:   

“I am the Prince! The victory is mine!”   

    Chylábborak:   

“Do not take cowardice for granted.”   

    Scarce had he said it, when   
His son, Kykéon, standing next to him   
Took Ajax’ final spear cast in his chest.   

“I shall not wear your armour, Sir,” he said.   
And died.   

“My son is dead.”   

    The Prince:   

“Hector is loved by God.”   

    And Greece, a wall of walking swords,   
But walking backwards,   
Leaving the plain in silence   
And in tears.   



    Idomeneo,   
Running back out at those Trojans who came too close:   
      

“You know my name. Come look for me. And boy,   
The day you do will be the day you die.”   



    Hector to Troy:   
“Soldiers!—   
Unmatched my force, unconquerable my will.   
After ten years of days, in one long day   
To be remembered for as many days   
As there are days to come, this is my day,   
Your Hector’s day. Troy given back to Troy.   
My day of victory!”   
      And when the cheering died:   
“Some say: destroy Greece now. But I say no.   
Out of your cars. Eat by your fires.   
Two hundred fires! Around each fire   
Five hundred men!   
“The sound of grindstones turning through the night,   
The firelight that stands between our blades,   
So let King Agamemnon’s Own hold hands   
And look into each other’s frightened eyes.   
“True God! Great Master of the Widespread Sky!   
If only you would turn   
Me into a god,   
As you, through me,   
Tomorrow by their ships   
Will see Greece die.”   



    Silence.   



    A ring of lights.   

    Within   

    Immaculate   

    In boat-cloaks lined with red   

    King Agamemnon’s lords—   

    The depression of retreat.   
The depression of returning to camp.   
Him at the centre of their circle   
Sobbing,   
Then shouting:   

“We must run for it!”   

    Dark glasses in parked cars.   



“King Agamemnon of Mycenae,   
God called, God raised, God recognized,   
You are a piece of shit,” Diomed said.   

    Silence again.   

“Let us praise God,” Lord Ajax said,   
“That Hector stopped before he reached the ships.”   

    Silence again.   

    Then   

    Nestor   
(Putting his knee back in):   

“Paramount Agamemnon, King of Kings,   
Lord of the Shore, the Islands and the Sea   
I shall begin, and end, with you.   
    Greece needs good words. Like them or not, the credit   
            will be yours.   
Determined. Keen to fight, that is our Diomed—   
As I should know. When just a boy of ten I fought   
Blowback of Missolonghi, a cannibal, drank blood,   
He captured you, he buggered you, you never walked again.   
But Diomed lacks experience.   
    God has saved us, momentarily.   
God loves Achilles.   
You took, and you have kept, Achilles’ ribband she.”   

“I was a fool!”   

“And now you must appease him, Agamemnon.   
Humble words. Hands shaken. Gifts.”   

    The King—wiping his eyes:   

“As usual,   
Pylos has said the only things worth hearing.   
I was mad to take the she.   
I shall pay fitting damages.   
Plus her, I offer him   
The Corfiot armour that my father wore.”   

    Silence.   

    The sea.   

    Its whispering.   

“To which I add: a set of shields.   
Posy, standard, ceremonial.   
The last, cut from the hide of a one ton Lesbian bull.”   

    Silence.   

    The sea.   

“And . . . a chariot!   
From my own équipe!   
They smoke along the ground . . .   
They ride its undulations like a breeze . . .”   

    The sea.   

“Plus: six horses—saddled, bridled and caparisoned,   
Their grooms and veterinarians . . .   

    . . . And six tall shes:   
Two good dancers, two good stitchers, two good cooks.   
All capable of bearing boys . . .   

“Oh, very well then: twenty loaves of gold,   
The same of silver, and the same of iron.”   

    Masks. Lights.   
Behind the lords   
Some hundreds from the army have walked up.   
    Lord Nestor smiles.   
Lord Menelaos smiles.   

“Plus—   
Though it may well reduce your King to destitution:   
    A’kimi’kúriex,   
My summer palace by the Argive sea,   
Its lawns, its terraces, its curtains in whose depths   
Larks dive above a field of waving lilies   
And fishscale-breakers shatter on blue rocks.   
Then, as he draws their silky heights aside,   
Standing among huge chests of looted booty,   
Long necked, with lowered lids, but candid eyes,   
My living daughter, Íphaniss, a diamond   
Big as a cheeseball for her belly stud.   
His wife to be! minus—I need not say—her otherwise huge   
          bride-price.”   

“More!”   
“More!”   
“More!”   

    Lord Ajax almost has to hold him up.   

“The whole of eastern Pel’po’nesia—   
An area of outstanding natural beauty—   
Its cities, Epi’dávros, Trów’é’zen,   
Their fortresses, their harbours and their fleets,   
Their taxpayers—glad to accept his modest ways—   
All this, the greatest benefaction ever known,   
If he agrees to fight. And he admits I am his King.”   

    Instantly, Nestor:   

“An offer God himself could not refuse.   
All that remains to say is:   
Who shall take it to Achilles?”   

    Agamemnon: “You will.”   



    Starlight.   

    The starlight on the sea.   



    The sea.   

    Its whispering   

    Mixed with the prayers   
Of Ajax and of Nestor as they walk   
Along the shore towards Achilles’ gate.   



“My lords?”   

“Your lord.”   

“This way.”   



    They find him, with guitar,   
Singing of Gilgamesh.   

“Take my hands. Here they are.”   

    You cannot take your eyes away from him.   
His own so bright they slow you down.   
His voice so low, and yet so clear.   
You know that he is dangerous.   



“Patroclus?   
Friends in need.   
    Still,   
Friends.   
    That has not changed,   
I think.   
    Autómedon? Wine.   



“Dear Lord and Master of the Widespread Sky,
      Accept ourselves, accept our prayers.”   



    Their cups are taken.   

“Father friend?”   

    King Nestor (for his life):   

“You know why we are here.   
    We face death.   
The mass choose slavery.   
Mycenae has admitted he was wrong to wrong yourself.   
In recompense he offers you   
The greatest benefaction ever known.   
Take it, and fight. Or else Hector will burn the ships   
Then kill us randomly.   
    Remember what your Father said   
The day when Ajax and myself drove up to ask   
If you could come with us to Troy?   
That you should stand among the blades where honour grows.   
And secondly, to let your anger go.   
    Spirit, and strength, and beauty have combined   
Such awesome power in you   
A vacant Heaven would offer you its throne.   
Think of what those who will come after us will say.   
    Save us from Hector’s god, from Hector, and from Hector’s force.   
I go down on my knees to you, Achilles.”   

“I must admire your courage, father friend,   
For treating me as if I was a fool.   
I shall deal with Hector as I want to.   
You and your fellow countrymen will die   
For how your King has treated me.   

    I have spent five years fighting for your King.   
My record is: ten coastal and ten inland cities   
Burnt to the ground. Their males, massacred.   
Their cattle, and their women, given to him.   
Among the rest, Briseis the Beautiful, my ribband she.   
Not that I got her courtesy of him.   
She joined my stock in recognition of   
My strength, my courage, my superiority,   
Courtesy of yourselves, my lords.   
    I will not fight for him.   
He aims to personalise my loss.   
Briseis taken from Achilles—standard practice:   
Helen from Menelaos—war.   
    Lord Busy Busy, building his palisade, mounting my she,   
One that I might have picked to run my house,   
Raising her to the status of a wife.   
    Do I hate him? Yes, I hate him. Hate him.   
And should he be afraid of me? He should.   
I want to harm him. I want him to feel pain.   
In his body, and between his ears.   
    I must admit,   
Some of the things that you have said are true.   
But look what he has done to me! To me!   
The king on whom his kingliness depends!   
I will not fight for him.   
    Hearing your steps, I thought: at last,   
My friends have come to visit me.   
They took their time about it, true—   
After he took my she none of you came—   
Now, though—admittedly they are in trouble,   
Serious trouble—they have arrived as friends,   
And of their own accord.   
    But you have not come here as friends.   
And you have not come of your own accord.   
You came because your King told you to come.   
You came because I am his last resort.   
And, incidentally, your last resort.   

    At least he offers stuff.   
All you have offered is advice:   
‘Keep your temper . . .   
    Mind your tongue . . .   
    Think what the world will say . . .’   
No mention of your King’s treatment of me.   
No sign of love for me behind your tears.   
    I will not fight for him.   
    I can remember very well indeed   
The day you two grand lords came visiting my father’s house,
How I ran out to you, and took your hands—   
The greatest men that I had ever seen:   
Ajax, my fighting cousin, strong, brave, unafraid to   die;   
Nestor, the King of Sandy Pylos, wisdom’s sword.   
And then, when all had had enough to eat and drink   
And it was sealed that I should come to Troy,   
Then my dear father said that lordship knows   
Not only how to fight, and when to hold its tongue,   
But of the difference between a child enraged   
And honour bound lords.   
    I will not fight for him.   
    There is a King to be maintained. You are his lords.   
My fighting powers prove my inferiority.   
Whatever he, through you, may grant,   
I must receive it as a favour, not of right,   
Go back to him with downcast looks, a suppliant tone,   
Acknowledge my transgressions—I did not   
Applaud his sticky fingers on my she’s meek flesh.   
    My mother says I have a choice:   
Live as a happy backwood king for aye   
Or give the world an everlasting murmur of my name,   
And die.   
    Be up tomorrow sharp   
To see me sacrifice to Lord Poseidon and set sail.   
    Oh, yes, his gifts:   
‘The greatest benefaction ever known.’   
    If he put Heaven in my hand I would not want it.   
His offers magnify himself.   
    Likewise his child.   
I do not want to trash the girl.   
She is like me. Bad luck to have poor friends.   
Bad luck to have his Kingship as your sire.   
    My father will select my wife.   
Each spring a dozen local kings drive up   
And lead their daughters naked round our yard.   
Some decent local girl. My father’s worth   
Is all the wealth we will require.   
    You Greeks will not take Troy.   
You have disintegrated as a fighting force.   
Troy is your cemetery. Blame your King.   
The man who you say has done all he can.   
The man who has admitted he was wrong.   
But he has not done all he can.   
And he has not admitted he was wrong.   
Or not to me.   
    I want him here, your King.   
His arms straight down his sides, his shoulders back,   
Announcing loud and clear that he was wrong to take my she.   
Apologising for that wrong, to me, the son of Péleus.   
Before my followers, with you, Pylos and Salamis,   
Crete. Sparta. Tyrins, Argos, Calydon, the Islands, here,   
Stood to attention on either side of him.   
      That is my offer. Take it, or die.   

    Nestor may stay the night.   
You, dear cousin Ajax, tell your King what I have said.   
Preferably, in front of everyone.”   
                     
                                    
                      Who said,   
As my Achilles lifted his guitar:   

“Lord, I was never so bethumped with words   
Since first I called my father Dad.”   



    The sea.   
Their feet along the sand to Agamemnon’s gate.   
And in starlit air   
The Trojans singing:   

“I love my wife, I love her dearly,   
      I love the hole she pisses through,   
      I love her lily-white tits   
      And her nut-brown arsehole,   
      I could eat her shit with a wooden spoon.”",Mythology and Folklore

Frederick Olmsted was right when he wrote
G.T.T. (Gone to Texas) was appended

Across the page for a hard couplet, a firm rhyme, ass

High as any downward dog, and cutlass arms

476,Hebrish,"At the confluence of tea roses and Russian sage
we made a right at the curved iron fence,
one of my dead friends beside me explaining how trees communicated
but I couldn’t understand a thing because it was all blurry —
the way it gets — and though I knew him well
I couldn’t say for sure now whether it was Larry or
Phil or Galway or Charlie until I realized it was me
talking in some kind of Hebrish they spoke
in my town by the Delaware and it was used
for code the way one of the Amerindian languages
was used in World War II the Germans couldn’t in a
million years break since they weren’t as pragmatic
irrational and in-your-face as the English and Americans were.

I noticed the bees were digging in for a late lunch
of what for them was boiled beef and horseradish
or maybe it was just for me and they were bent over
guzzling madly while paying no attention to the two
of us or in any way tired of the nectars since it
ran the whole gamut from oysters to soup to — well —
boiled beef to strawberry-rhubarb pie
and a little whisky after, some of it spilled on the
vanilla ice cream that underlaid the pie it had once overlaid,
all of this depending on the blossoms they circled over
and bent down upon, a cafeteria as good as the one
on Broadway called Stanley’s I circled and bent over
expending nickels dimes and quarters when the Dulles brothers
ran the country.

It was Larry, I’m sure now,
and what we talked about was cardboard
and we were amazed that in the open spaces
beside the hotel on 47th Street
there were four or five small cardboard “houses,”
both of us remembered,
the homeless had claimed to sleep in and provide
a safe place for their black plastic garbage bags,
the size of a room at the Sloane House on 34th Street
near the Pennsylvania Station where I put up
the price of a meal then for a clean pillowcase
with little or no stuffing and a cardboard
bed as stiff as metal and a cardboard
breakfast of cardboard bread and eggs and between us
we talked cardboard, shirts from the cleaners with sheets of
cardboard we drew on, cardboard soles in ruined shoes
we both wore when we were children, cardboard hats,
cardboard to lie on listening to outdoor concerts
and cardboard masks we made with scissors and crayon
for costume dances, balls is what we called them
as if we were art students in Paris about to
swim in the nearest fountain.

Though what I want to
say is the bees were too busy to do us any
harm and it was packs of wild dogs, not swarms
of bees, that terrified me (Larry, too) except for one
occasion when I pushed the wrong end of an old
broom into a hive of yellow jackets on the underside
of a low-lying garage roof and an angry swarm chased
me through the yard and over a fence hating
any form of criminal intrusion, urban renewal, or
gentrification, I who couldn’t resist intrusions,
who never could, omnivorous as I was, living on
apples and bananas as well as baby lamb chops,
who ran like hell that day (Larry, too)

478,from From the Theatre of Illusion,"Act 2, Scene 2
Clindor, a young picaresque hero, has been living by his wits in Paris, but has now drifted to Bordeaux, to become the valet of a braggart bravo named Matamore. He is chiefly employed as a go-between, carrying Matamore's amorous messages to the beautiful Isabelle—who only suffers the master because she is in love with the messenger.
CLINDOR
Sir, why so restless? Is there any need,
With all your fame, for one more glorious deed?
Have you not slain enough bold foes by now,
And must you have fresh laurels for your brow?

MATAMORE
It's true, I'm restless, and I can't decide
Which of two foes should first be nullified—
The Mogul emperor or the Persian Sophy.

CLINDOR
Ah, let them live a while, Sir. Neither trophy
Would add a great deal to your fame and standing.
And where's the army that you'd be commanding?

MATAMORE
Army? Ah, villain, coward, do you doubt
That with this arm alone I'd wipe them out?
The mere sound of my name makes ramparts yield,
And drives divisions from the battlefield;
My wrath against these rulers needs engage
Only a piddling portion of my rage;
With one commandment given to the Fates
I oust the strongest monarchs from their states;
Thunder's my cannon; my troops, the Destinies;
One blow lays low a thousand enemies;
One breath, and all their hopes go up in smoke.
Yet you dare speak of armies! What a joke!
No longer shall a second Mars employ you;
With but a glance, you rogue, I shall destroy you      ...
And yet the thought of her whom I adore
Softens me now, and I'm enraged no more;
That little archer, whom every God obeys,
Forbids my eyes to glare with lethal rays.
Observe how my ferocity, which hates
And hacks and slaughters, gently dissipates
When I recall my lady, and my face
Is changed by thoughts of beauty, love, and grace.

CLINDOR
Oh, Sir, you have a hundred selves or more;
You're as handsome now as you were grim before.
I can't imagine any lady who
Could stubbornly refuse her heart to you.

MATAMORE
Whatever I may have said, feel no alarm:
Sometimes I terrify, sometimes I charm;
Depending on my humor, I inspire
Men with anxiety, women with desire.
Before I had the power to suppress
My beauty, women gave me much distress:
When I appeared, they swooned in quantity,
And thousands died each day for love of me.
With every princess I had many a tryst,
And every queen came begging to be kissed;
The Ethiopian and the Japanese
Murmured my name in all their sighs and pleas.
Two sultanesses could not but adore me,
Two more escaped from the seraglio fòr me,
Which strained my friendship with the Turkish nation.

CLINDOR
Their anger could but gild your reputation.

MATAMORE
Still, all that was more trouble than it was worth.
It balked my plans for conquering the earth.
What's more, I tired of it, and to deter
Such nuisances sent word to Jupiter
That if he could not put a stop to these
Fond women and their importunities,
I'd rise up in a rage and end his reign
As ruler of the Gods, and would obtain
For Mars the right to throw his bolts of thunder.
Needless to say, the coward knuckled under:
He did as I desired, and now, you see,
I'm handsome only when I choose to be.

CLINDOR
What love notes you'd receive, were that not so!

MATAMORE
Don't bring me any      ...      unless from her, you know.
What does she say of me?

CLINDOR
                                                                         Today she said
That you inspire all hearts with love and dread,
And that if what you promise her comes true,
She'll feel herself a Goddess, thanks to you.

MATAMORE
Back in the times I've just been speaking of,
Goddesses, also, pestered me for love,
And I shall tell you of a strange event
Which caused confusion without precedent
And threw all nature into disarray.
The Sun was powerless to rise one day
Because that bright, much-worshipped deity
Could not find where the Dawn, his guide, might be.
He sought her everywhere, in Cephalus' bower,
In old Tithonus' bed, in Memnon's tower,
But since Aurora nowhere was in sight,
The day, till noontide, was as black as night.

CLINDOR
Where was the Goddess, during these alarms?

MATAMORE
In my bedchamber, offering me her charms.
But she gained nothing by such shameless actions;
My heart was blind to all her bright attractions,
And all she got by showing off her beauty
Was a firm command to go and do her duty.

CLINDOR
That curious story, Sir, I now recall.
I was in Mexico, where I heard it all.
They said that Persia, vexed by the insult to
Their famous Sun God, had it in for you.

MATAMORE
I heard as much, and would have made them pay,
But was in Transylvania that day,
Where their ambassador hastened to appease
My wrath with presents and apologies.

CLINDOR
Your brave heart showed them clemency. How fine!

MATAMORE
Just look, my friend, upon this face of mine.
There every human virtue can be found.
Of all the foes I've stamped into the ground,
Whose kingdoms are annulled and cast aside,
There was not one who did not fall through pride.
But those who humbly honored my perfection
Have kept their power through a wise subjection.
The modest kings of Europe are all my vassals;
I do not sack their towns or wreck their castles;
I let them reign. But it's another story
In Africa, where I scorched the territory
Of certain kings who lacked humility,
And left great deserts there for all to see.
Those endless sands, beneath those skies of fire,
Are a great monument to my righteous ire.

CLINDOR
Let us revert to love; your lady's here.

MATAMORE
My cursèd rival's at her side, I fear.

CLINDOR
Where are you going?

MATAMORE
                                                    He isn't brave, this dunce,
And yet he's vain, and could be bold for once.
Perhaps he'll challenge me from foolish pride,
Merely because he's at the lady's side.

CLINDOR
By doing so, the fool might come to harm.

MATAMORE
I can't be valorous when I'm full of charm.

CLINDOR
Cease to be charming and be terrible, Sir.

MATAMORE
Oh, you don't realize what that would incur.
I can't be terrible by halves, you know;
I'd slaughter both my mistress and my foe.
Until they part, let's stand aside and wait.

CLINDOR
Your prudence, like your valor, is very great.

481,In October 1914 [Antwerp],"I 
GLOOM! 
An October like November; 
August a hundred thousand hours, 
And all September, 
A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, 
And half October like a thousand years . . . 
And doom! 
That then was Antwerp. . . 
                              In the name of God, 
How could they do it? 
Those souls that usually dived 
Into the dirty caverns of mines; 
Who usually hived 
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; 
Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, 
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . 
Those men there, with the appearance of clods 
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God 
Ever shrived. . . 
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. 
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them 
To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, 
Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, 
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. 
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours 
For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays 
Is this: 
In the name of God, how could they do it? 


II 
For there is no new thing under the sun, 
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun 
In the gloom. . . 
What the devil will he gain by it? 
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it 
Waiting his doom; 
The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, 
Till the trench of gray mud 
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. 
Well, there have been scars 
Won in many wars . . .
Punic, 
Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, 
But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, 
His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, 
Overspreading his miserable land, 
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . 
Doom! 
He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, 
And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . 
An image that shall take long to pass! 


III 
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses 
Forever through our brains. 
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; 
And battalions and battalions and battalions 
The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, 
Pass, for ever staunch, 
Stand, for ever true; 
And the small man with the large paunch, 
And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, 
Watches them pass 
In our minds for ever . . . 
But that clutter of sodden corses 
On the sodden Belgian grass 
That is a strange new beauty. 


IV 
With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, 
Assuredly that is the way of it, 
The way of beauty . . . 
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. 
For you cannot praise it with words 
Compounded of lyres and swords, 
But the thought of the gloom and the rain 
And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, 
Shall eat itself into your brain: 
And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! 
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. 
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. 
And that shall be an honourable name; 
Belgian shall be an honourable word; 
As honourable as the fame of the sword, 
As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, 
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. 


V 
And what in the world did they bear it for? 
I don't know. 
And what in the world did they dare it for? 
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. 
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go 
Over their fields and between their cities 
Down into more southerly regions. 
They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, 
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. 
I don't understand. 
Was it just love of their land? 
Oh, poor dears! 
Can any man so love his land? 
Give them a thousand thousand pities 
And rivers and rivers of tears 
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. 


VI 
This is Charing Cross; 
It is midnight; 
There is a great crowd 
And no light. 
A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. 
Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! 
She has a dead face; 
She is dressed all in black; 
She wanders to the bookstall and back, 
At the back of the crowd; 
And back again and again back, 
She sways and wanders. 

This is Charing Cross; 
It is one o'clock. 
There is still a great cloud, and very little light; 
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd 
That hardly whispers aloud. . . 
And now! .  . That is another dead mother, 
And there is another and another and another. . . 
And little children, all in black, 
All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, 
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room 
In the dim gloom. 
These are the women of Flanders.
They await the lost. 
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; 
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train 
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; 
They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, 
In the dark of the night. 
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; 
There is very little light. 

There is so much pain. 


LEnvoi 
And it was for this that they endured this gloom; 
This October like November, 
That August like a hundred thousand hours, 
And that September, 
A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, 
And half October like a thousand years. . .

       irreconcilable ...

And yet, suppose some evening I forgot
The fare and transfer, yet got by that way
Without recall,lost yet poised in traffic.
Then I might find your eyes across an aisle,
Still flickering with those prefigurations
Prodigal, yet uncontested now,
Half-riant before the jerky window frame.

There is some way, I think, to touch
Those hands of yours that count the nights
Stippled with pink and green advertisements.
And now, before its arteries turn dark
I would have you meet this bartered blood.
Imminent in his dream, none better knows
The white wafer cheek of love, or offers words
Lightly as moonlight on the eaves meets snow.

Reflective conversion of all things
At your deep blush, when ecstasies thread
The limbs and belly, when rainbows spread
Impinging on the throat and sides ...   
Inevitable, the body of the world
Weeps in inventive dust for the hiatus
That winks above it, bluet in your breasts.

The earth may glide diaphanous to death;
But if I lift my arms it is to bend
To you who turned away once, Helen, knowing
The press of troubled hands, too alternate
With steel and soil to hold you endlessly.
I meet you, therefore, in that eventual flame
You found in final chains, no captive then
Beyond their million brittle, bloodshot eyes;
White, through white cities passed on to assume
That world which comes to each of us alone.
Accept a lone eye riveted to your plane,
Bent axle of devotion along companion ways
That beat, continuous, to hourless days
One inconspicuous, glowing orb of praise.

Brazen hypnotics glitter here;
Glee shifts from foot to foot,
Magnetic to their tremulo.
This crashing opera bouffe,
Blest excursion! this ricochet
From roof to roof
Know, Olympians, we are breathless
While nigger cupids scour the stars!

A thousand light shrugs balance us
Through snarling hails of melody.
White shadows slip across the floor
Splayed like cards from a loose hand;
Rhythmic ellipses lead into canters
Until somewhere a rooster banters.

Greet naivelyyet intrepidly
New soothings, new amazements
That cornets introduce at every turn
And you may fall downstairs with me
With perfect grace and equanimity.
Or, plaintively scud past shores
Where, by strange harmonic laws
All relatives, serene and cool,
Sit rocked in patent armchairs.

O,I have known metallic paradises
Where cuckoos clucked to finches
Above the deft catastrophes of drums.
While titters hailed the groans of death
Beneath gyrating awnings I have seen
The incunabula of the divine grotesque.
This music has a reassuring way.

The siren of the springs of guilty song
Let us take her on the incandescent wax
Striated with nuances, nervosities
That we are heir to: she is still so young,
We cannot frown upon her as she smiles,
Dipping here in this cultivated storm
Among slim skaters of the gardened skies.

Who hurried the hill breezes, spouting malice
Plangent over meadows, and looked down

We know, eternal gunman, our flesh remembers
The tensile boughs, the nimble blue plateaus,
The mounted, yielding cities of the air!

The which to heare, vouchsafe, O dearest dred a-while.

i
A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine,
Y cladd in mightie armes and silver shielde,
Wherein old dints of deepe wounds did remaine,
The cruell markes of many a bloudy fielde;
Yet armes till that time did he never wield:
His angry steede did chide his foming bitt,
As much disdayning to the curbe to yield:
Full jolly knight he seemd, and faire did sitt,
As one for knightly giusts and fierce encounters fitt.

ii
But on his brest a bloudie Crosse he bore,
The deare remembrance of his dying Lord,
For whose sweete sake that glorious badge he wore,
And dead as living ever him ador'd:
Upon his shield the like was also scor'd,
For soveraine hope, which in his helpe he had:
Right faithfull true he was in deede and word,
But of his cheere did seeme too solemne sad;
Yet nothing did he dread, but ever was ydrad.

iii
Upon a great adventure he was bond,
That greatest Gloriana to him gave,
That greatest Glorious Queene of Faerie lond,
To winne him worship, and her grace to have,
Which of all earthly things he most did crave;
And ever as he rode, his hart did earne
To prove his puissance in battell brave
Upon his foe, and his new force to learne;
Upon his foe, a Dragon horrible and stearne.

iv
A lovely Ladie rode him faire beside,
Upon a lowly Asse more white then snow,
Yet she much whiter, but the same did hide
Under a vele, that wimpled was full low,
And over all a blacke stole she did throw,
As one that inly mournd: so was she sad,
And heavie sat upon her palfrey slow;
Seemed in heart some hidden care she had,
And by her in a line a milke white lambe she lad.

v
So pure an innocent, as that same lambe,
She was in life and every vertuous lore,
And by descent from Royall lynage came
Of ancient Kings and Queenes, that had of yore
Their scepters stretcht from East to Westerne shore,
And all the world in their subjection held;
Till that infernall feend with foule uprore
Forwasted all their land, and them expeld:
Whom to avenge, she had this Knight from far compeld.

vi
Behind her farre away a Dwarfe did lag,
That lasie seemd in being ever last,
Or wearied with bearing of her bag
Of needments at his backe. Thus as they past,
The day with cloudes was suddeine overcast,
And angry Jove an hideous storme of raine
Did poure into his Lemans lap so fast,
That every wight to shrowd it did constrain,
And this faire couple eke to shroud themselves were fain.

vii
Enforst to seeke some covert nigh at hand,
A shadie grove not far away they spide,
That promist ayde the tempest to withstand:
Whose loftie trees yclad with sommers pride,
Did spred so broad, that heavens light did hide,
Not perceable with power of any starre:
And all within were pathes and alleies wide,
With footing worne, and leading inward farre:
Faire harbour that them seemes; so in they entred arre.

viii
And foorth they passe, with pleasure forward led,
Joying to heare the birdes sweete harmony,
Which therein shrouded from the tempest dred,
Seemd in their song to scorne the cruell sky.
Much can they prayse the trees so straight and hy,
The sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall,
The vine-prop Elme, the Poplar never dry,
The builder Oake, sole king of forrests all,
The Aspine good for staves, the Cypresse funerall.

ix
The Laurell, meed of mightie Conquerours
And Poets sage, the Firre that weepeth still,
The Willow worne of forlorne Paramours,
The Eugh obedient to the benders will,
The Birch for shaftes, the Sallow for the mill,
The Mirrhe sweete bleeding in the bitter wound,
The warlike Beech, the Ash for nothing ill,
The fruitfull Olive, and the Platane round,
The carver Holme, the Maple seeldom inward sound.

x
Led with delight, they thus beguile the way,
Untill the blustring storme is overblowne;
When weening to returne, whence they did stray,
They cannot find that path, which first was showne,
But wander too and fro in wayes unknowne,
Furthest from end then, when they neerest weene,
That makes them doubt, their wits be not their owne:
So many pathes, so many turnings seene,
That which of them to take, in diverse doubt they been.

xi
At last resolving forward still to fare,
Till that some end they finde or in or out,
That path they take, that beaten seemd most bare,
And like to lead the labyrinth about;
Which when by tract they hunted had throughout,
At length it brought them to a hollow cave,
Amid the thickest woods. The Champion stout
Eftsoones dismounted from his courser brave,
And to the Dwarfe a while his needlesse spere he gave.

xii
Be well aware, quoth then that Ladie milde,
Least suddaine mischiefe ye too rash provoke:
The danger hid, the place unknowne and wilde,
Breeds dreadfull doubts: Oft fire is without smoke,
And perill without show: therefore your stroke
Sir knight with-hold, till further triall made.
Ah Ladie (said he) shame were to revoke
The forward footing for an hidden shade:
Vertue gives her selfe light, through darkenesse for to wade.

xiii
Yea but (quoth she) the perill of this place
I better wot then you, though now too late
To wish you backe returne with foule disgrace,
Yet wisedome warnes, whilest foot is in the gate,
To stay the steppe, ere forced to retrate.
This is the wandring wood, this Errours den,
A monster vile, whom God and man does hate:
Therefore I read beware. Fly fly (quoth then
The fearefull Dwarfe:) this is no place for living men.

xiv
But full of fire and greedy hardiment,
The youthfull knight could not for ought be staide,
But forth unto the darksome hole he went,
And looked in: his glistring armor made
A litle glooming light, much like a shade,
By which he saw the ugly monster plaine,
Halfe like a serpent horribly displaide,
But th'other halfe did womans shape retaine,
Most lothsom, filthie, foule, and full of vile disdaine.

xv
And as she lay upon the durtie ground,
Her huge long taile her den all overspred,
Yet was in knots and many boughtes upwound,
Pointed with mortall sting. Of her there bred
A thousand yong ones, which she dayly fed,
Sucking upon her poisonous dugs, eachone
Of sundry shapes, yet all ill favored:
Soone as that uncouth light upon them shone,
Into her mouth they crept, and suddain all were gone.

xvi
Their dam upstart, out of her den effraide,
And rushed forth, hurling her hideous taile
About her cursed head, whose folds displaid
Were stretcht now forth at length without entraile.
She lookt about, and seeing one in mayle
Armed to point, sought backe to turne againe;
For light she hated as the deadly bale,
Ay wont in desert darknesse to remaine,
Where plaine none might her see, nor she see any plaine.

xvii
Which when the valiant Elfe perceiv'd, he lept
As Lyon fierce upon the flying pray,
And with his trenchand blade her boldly kept
From turning backe, and forced her to stay:
Therewith enrag'd she loudly gan to bray,
And turning fierce, her speckled taile advaunst,
Threatning her angry sting, him to dismay:
Who nought aghast, his mightie hand enhaunst:
The stroke down from her head unto her shoulder glaunst.

xviii
Much daunted with that dint, her sence was dazd,
Yet kindling rage, her selfe she gathered round,
And all attonce her beastly body raizd
With doubled forces high above the ground:
Tho wrapping up her wrethed sterne arownd,
Lept fierce upon his shield, and her huge traine
All suddenly about his body wound,
That hand or foot to stirre he strove in vaine:
God helpe the man so wrapt in Errours endlesse traine.

xix
His Lady sad to see his sore constraint,
Cride out, Now now Sir knight, shew what ye bee,
Add faith unto your force, and be not faint:
Strangle her, else she sure will strangle thee.
That when he heard, in great perplexitie,
His gall did grate for griefe and high disdaine,
And knitting all his force got one hand free,
Wherewith he grypt her gorge with so great paine,
That soone to loose her wicked bands did her constraine.

xx
Therewith she spewd out of her filthy maw
A floud of poyson horrible and blacke,
Full of great lumpes of flesh and gobbets raw,
Which stunck so vildly, that it forst him slacke
His grasping hold, and from her turne him backe:
Her vomit full of bookes and papers was,
With loathly frogs and toades, which eyes did lacke,
And creeping sought way in the weedy gras:
Her filthy parbreake all the place defiled has.

xxi
As when old father Nilus gins to swell
With timely pride above the Aegyptian vale,
His fattie waves do fertile slime outwell,
And overflow each plaine and lowly dale:
But when his later spring gins to avale,
Huge heapes of mudd he leaves, wherein there breed
Ten thousand kindes of creatures, partly male
And partly female of his fruitfull seed;
Such ugly monstrous shapes elsewhere may no man reed.

xxii
The same so sore annoyed has the knight,
That welnigh choked with the deadly stinke,
His forces faile, ne can no longer fight.
Whose corage when the feend perceiv'd to shrinke,
She poured forth out of her hellish sinke
Her fruitfull cursed spawne of serpents small,
Deformed monsters, fowle, and blacke as inke,
Which swarming all about his legs did crall,
And him encombred sore, but could not hurt at all.

xxiii
As gentle Shepheard in sweete even-tide,
When ruddy Phoebus gins to welke in west,
High on an hill, his flocke to vewen wide,
Markes which do byte their hasty supper best;
A cloud of combrous gnattes do him molest,
All striving to infixe their feeble stings,
That from their noyance he no where can rest,
But with his clownish hands their tender wings
He brusheth oft, and oft doth mar their murmurings.

xxiv
Thus ill bestedd, and fearefull more of shame,
Then of the certaine perill he stood in,
Halfe furious unto his foe he came,
Resolv'd in minde all suddenly to win,
Or soone to lose, before he once would lin;
And strooke at her with more then manly force,
That from her body full of filthie sin
He raft her hatefull head without remorse;
A streame of cole black bloud forth gushed from her corse.

xxv
Her scattred brood, soone as their Parent deare
They saw so rudely falling to the ground,
Groning full deadly, all with troublous feare,
Gathred themselves about her body round,
Weening their wonted entrance to have found
At her wide mouth: but being there withstood
They flocked all about her bleeding wound,
And sucked up their dying mothers blood,
Making her death their life, and eke her hurt their good.

xxvi
That detestable sight him much amazde,
To see th'unkindly Impes of heaven accurst,
Devoure their dam; on whom while so he gazd,
Having all satisfide their bloudy thurst,
Their bellies swolne he saw with fulnesse burst,
And bowels gushing forth: well worthy end
Of such as drunke her life, the which them nurst;
Now needeth him no lenger labour spend,
His foes have slaine themselves, with whom he should contend.

xxvii
His Ladie seeing all, that chaunst, from farre
Approcht in hast to greet his victorie,
And said, Faire knight, borne under happy starre,
Who see your vanquisht foes before you lye:
Well worthy be you of that Armorie,
Wherein ye have great glory wonne this day,
And proov'd your strength on a strong enimie,
Your first adventure: many such I pray,
And henceforth ever wish, that like succeed it may.

xxviii
Then mounted he upon his Steede againe,
And with the Lady backward sought to wend;
That path he kept, which beaten was most plame,
Ne ever would to any by-way bend,
But still did follow one unto the end,
The which at last out of the wood them brought.
So forward on his way (with God to frend)
He passed forth, and new adventure sought;
Long way he travelled, before he heard of ought.

xxix
At length they chaunst to meet upon the way
An aged Sire, in long blacke weedes yclad,
His feete all bare, his beard all hoarie gray,
And by his belt his booke he hanging had;
Sober he seemde, and very sagely sad,
And to the ground his eyes were lowly bent,
Simple in shew, and voyde of malice bad,
And all the way he prayed, as he went,
And often knockt his brest, as one that did repent.

xxx
He faire the knight saluted, louting low,
Who faire him quited, as that courteous was:
And after asked him, if he did know
Of straunge adventures, which abroad did pas.
Ah my deare Sonne (quoth he) how should, alas,
Silly old man, that lives in hidden cell,
Bidding his beades all day for his trespas,
Tydings of warre and worldly trouble tell?
With holy father sits not with such things to mell.

xxxi
But if of daunger which hereby doth dwell,
And homebred evill ye desire to heare,
Of a straunge man I can you tidings tell,
That wasteth all this countrey farre and neare.
Of such (said he) I chiefly do inquere,
And shall you well reward to shew the place,
In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare:
For to all knighthood it is foule disgrace,
That such a cursed creature lives so long a space.

xxxii
Far hence (quoth he) in wastfull wildernesse
His dwelling is, by which no living wight
May ever passe, but thorough great distresse.
Now (sayd the Lady) draweth toward night,
And well I wote, that of your later fight
Ye all forwearied be: for what so strong,
But wanting rest will also want of might?
The Sunne that measures heaven all day long,
At night doth baite his steedes the Ocean waves emong.

xxxiii
Then with the Sunne take Sir, your timely rest,
And with new day new worke at once begin:
Untroubled night they say gives counsell best.
Right well Sir knight ye have advised bin,
(Quoth then that aged man;) the way to win
Is wisely to advise: now day is spent;
Therefore with me ye may take up your In
For this same night. The knight was well content:
So with that godly father to his home they went.

xxxiv
A little lowly Hermitage it was,
Downe in a dale, hard by a forests side,
Far from resort of people, that did pas
In travell to and froe: a little wyde
There was an holy Chappell edifyde,
Wherein the Hermite dewly wont to say
His holy things each morne and eventyde:
Thereby a Christall streame did gently play,
Which from a sacred fountaine welled forth alway.

xxxv
Arrived there, the little house they fill,
Ne looke for entertainement, where none was:
Rest is their feast, and all things at their will;
The noblest mind the best contentment has.
With faire discourse the evening so they pas:
For that old man of pleasing wordes had store,
And well could file his tongue as smooth as glas;
He told of Saintes and Popes, and evermore
He strowd an Ave-Mary after and before.

xxxvi
The drouping Night thus creepeth on them fast,
And the sad humour loading their eye liddes,
As messenger of Morpheus on them cast
Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleepe them biddes.
Unto their lodgings then his guestes he riddes:
Where when all drownd in deadly sleepe he findes,
He to his study goes, and there amiddes
His Magick bookes and artes of sundry kindes,
He seekes out mighty charmes, to trouble sleepy mindes.

xxxvii
Then choosing out few wordes most horrible,
(Let none them read) thereof did verses frame,
With which and other spelles like terrible,
He bad awake blacke Plutoes griesly Dame,
And cursed heaven, and spake reprochfull shame
Of highest God, the Lord of life and light;
A bold bad man, that dar'd to call by name
Great Gorgon, Prince of darknesse and dead night,
At which Cocytus quakes, and Styx is put to flight.

xxxviii
And forth he cald out of deepe darknesse dred
Legions of Sprights, the which like little flyes
Fluttring about his ever damned hed,
A-waite whereto their service he applyes,
To aide his friends, or fray his enimies:
Of those he chose out two, the falsest twoo,
And fittest for to forge true-seeming lyes;
The one of them he gave a message too,
The other by him selfe staide other worke to doo.

xxxix
He making speedy way through spersed ayre,
And through the world of waters wide and peepe,
To Morpheus house doth hastily repaire.
Amid the bowels of the earth full steepe,
And low, where dawning day doth never peepe,
His dwelling is; there Tethys his wet bed
Doth ever wash, and Cynthia still doth steepe
In silver deaw his ever-drouping hed,
Whiles sad Night over him her mantle black doth spred.

xl
Whose double gates he findeth locked fast,
The one faire fram'd of burnisht Yvory,
The other all with silver overcast;
And wakefull dogges before them farre do lye
Watching to banish Care their enimy,
Who oft is wont to trouble gentle Sleepe.
By them the Sprite doth passe in quietly,
And unto Morpheus comes, whom drowned deepe
In drowsie fit he findes: of nothing he takes keepe.

xli
And more, to lulle him in his slumber soft,
A trickling streame from high rocke tumbling downe
And ever-drizling raine upon the loft,
Mixt with a murmuring winde, much like the sowne
Of swarming Bees, did cast him in a swowne:
No other noyse, nor peoples troublous cryes,
As still are wont t'annoy the walled towne,

Wrapt in eternall silence farre from enemyes.

xlii
The messenger approching to him spake,
But his wast wordes returnd to him in vaine:
So sound he slept, that nought mought him awake.
Then rudely he him thrust, and pusht with paine,
Whereat he gan to stretch: but he againe
Shooke him so hard, that forced him to speake.
As one then in a dreame, whose dryer braine
In tost with troubled sights and fancies weake,
He mumbled soft, but would not all his silence breake.

xliii
The Sprite then gan more boldly him to wake,
And threatned unto him the dreaded name
Of Hecate: whereat he gan to quake,
And lifting up his lumpish head, with blame
Halfe angry asked him, for what he came.
Hither (quoth he) me Archimago sent,
He that the stubborne Sprites can wisely tame,
He bids thee to him send for his intent
A fit false dreame, that can delude the sleepers sent.

xliv
The God obayde, and calling forth straight way
A diverse dreame out of his prison darke,
Delivered it to him, and downe did lay
His heavie head, devoide of carefull carke,
Whose sences all were straight benumbed and starke.
He backe returning by the Yvorie dore,
Remounted up as light as chearefull Larke,
And on his litle winges the dreame he bore
In hast unto his Lord, where he him left afore.

Who all this while with charmes and hidden artes,
Had made a Lady of that other Spright,
And fram'd of liquid ayre her tender partes
So lively, and so like in all mens sight,
That weaker sence it could have ravisht quight:
The maker selfe for all his wondrous witt,
Was nigh beguiled with so goodly sight:
Her all in white he clad, and over it
Cast a blacke stole, most like to seeme for Una fit.

xlvi
Now when that ydle dreame was to him brought,
Unto that Elfin knight he bad him fly,
Where he slept soundly void of evill thought
And with false shewes abuse his fantasy,
In sort as he him schooled privily:
And that new creature borne without her dew,
Full of the makers guile, with usage sly
He taught to imitate that Lady trew,
Whose semblance she did carrie under feigned hew.

xlvii
Thus well instructed, to their worke they hast,
And comming where the knight in slomber lay,
The one upon his hardy head him plast,
And made him dreame of loves and lustfull play,
That nigh his manly hart did melt away,
Bathed in wanton blis and wicked joy:
Then seemed him his Lady by him lay,
And to him playnd, how that false winged boy,
Her chast hart had subdewd, to learne Dame pleasures toy.

xlviii
And she her selfe of beautie soveraigne Queene,
Faire Venus seemde unto his bed to bring
Her, whom he waking evermore did weene,
To be the chastest flowre, that ay did spring
On earthly braunch, the daughter of a king,
Now a loose Leman to vile service bound:
And eke the Graces seemed all to sing,
Hymen {i}{_o} Hymen, dauncing all around,
While freshest Flora her with Yvie girlond crownd.

xlix
In this great passion of unwonted lust,
Or wonted feare of doing ought amis,
He started up, as seeming to mistrust
Some secret ill, or hidden foe of his:
Lo there before his face his Lady is,
Under blake stole hyding her bayted hooke,
And as halfe blushing offred him to kis,
With gentle blandishment and lovely looke,
Most like that virgin true, which for her knight him took.

l
All cleane dismayd to see so uncouth sight,
And halfe enraged at her shamelesse guise,
He thought have slaine her in his fierce despight:
But hasty heat tempring with sufferance wise,
He stayde his hand, and gan himselfe advise
To prove his sense, and tempt her faigned truth.
Wringing her hands in wemens pitteous wise,
Tho can she weepe, to stirre up gentle ruth,
Both for her noble bloud, and for her tender youth.

And said, Ah Sir, my liege Lord and my love,
Shall I accuse the hidden cruell fate,
And mightie causes wrought in heaven above,
Or the blind God, that doth me thus amate,
For hoped love to winne me certaine hate?
Yet thus perforce he bids me do, or die.
Die is my dew: yet rew my wretched state

Hath made judge of my life or death indifferently.

Captiv'd to fortune and frayle worldly feares,
Fly to your faith for succour and sure ayde:
Let me not dye in languor and long teares.

Suspect her truth: yet since no'untruth he knew,

For all so deare as life is to my hart,

Where cause is none, but to your rest depart.
Not all content, yet seemd she to appease
Her mournefull plaintes, beguiled of her art,
And fed with words, that could not chuse but please,
So slyding softly forth, she turnd as to her ease.

Long after lay he musing at her mood,
Much griev'd to think that gentle Dame so light,
For whose defence he was to shed his blood.
At last dull wearinesse of former fight

And thee, feign'd vestal, in worse arms shall see;
Then thy sick taper will begin to wink,

Her forehead yvory white,
Her cheekes lyke apples which the sun hath rudded,
Her lips lyke cherryes charming men to byte,
Her brest like to a bowle of creame uncrudded,
Her paps lyke lyllies budded,
Her snowie necke lyke to a marble towre,
And all her body like a pallace fayre,
Ascending uppe with many a stately stayre,
To honors seat and chastities sweet bowre.
Why stand ye still ye virgins in amaze,
Upon her so to gaze,
Whiles ye forget your former lay to sing,

The inward beauty of her lively spright,
Garnisht with heavenly guifts of high degree,

Medusaes mazeful hed.
There dwels sweet love and constant chastity,
Unspotted fayth and comely womenhed,

Hearing the holy priest that to her speakes

About the sacred Altare doe remaine,
Forget their service and about her fly,
Ofte peeping in her face that seemes more fayre,
The more they on it stare.

Are governed with goodly modesty,

Poure not by cups, but by the belly full,
Poure out to all that wull,
And sprinkle all the postes and wals with wine,
That they may sweat, and drunken be withall.
Crowne ye God Bacchus with a coronall,
And Hymen also crowne with wreathes of vine,
And let the Graces daunce unto the rest;

The whiles the maydens doe theyr carroll sing,
To which the woods shal answer and theyr eccho ring.

Ring ye the bels, ye yong men of the towne,
And leave your wonted labors for this day:
This day is holy; doe ye write it downe,
That ye for ever it remember may.
This day the sunne is in his chiefest hight,
With Barnaby the bright,
From whence declining daily by degrees,
He somewhat loseth of his heat and light,
When once the Crab behind his back he sees.
But for this time it ill ordained was,
To chose the longest day in all the yeare,
And shortest night, when longest fitter weare:
Yet never day so long, but late would passe.
Ring ye the bels, to make it weare away,
And bonefiers make all day,
And daunce about them, and about them sing:
That all the woods may answer, and your eccho ring.

Ah when will this long weary day have end,
And lende me leave to come unto my love?
How slowly do the houres theyr numbers spend?
How slowly does sad Time his feathers move?
Hast thee O fayrest Planet to thy home
Within the Westerne fome:
Thy tyred steedes long since have need of rest.
Long though it be, at last I see it gloome,
And the bright evening star with golden creast
Appeare out of the East.
Fayre childe of beauty, glorious lampe of love
That all the host of heaven in rankes doost lead,
And guydest lovers through the nightes dread,
How chearefully thou lookest from above,
And seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light
As joying in the sight
Of these glad many which for joy doe sing,
That all the woods them answer and their echo ring.

Now ceasse ye damsels your delights forepast;
Enough is it, that all the day was youres:
Now day is doen, and night is nighing fast:
Now bring the Bryde into the brydall boures.
Now night is come, now soone her disaray,
And in her bed her lay;
Lay her in lillies and in violets,
And silken courteins over her display,
And odourd sheetes, and Arras coverlets.
Behold how goodly my faire love does ly
In proud humility;
Like unto Maia, when as Jove her tooke,
In Tempe, lying on the flowry gras,
Twixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was,
With bathing in the Acidalian brooke.
Now it is night, ye damsels may be gon,
And leave my love alone,
And leave likewise your former lay to sing:
The woods no more shal answere, nor your echo ring.

Now welcome night, thou night so long expected,
That long daies labour doest at last defray,
And all my cares, which cruell love collected,
Hast sumd in one, and cancelled for aye:
Spread thy broad wing over my love and me,
That no man may us see,
And in thy sable mantle us enwrap,
From feare of perrill and foule horror free.
Let no false treason seeke us to entrap,
Nor any dread disquiet once annoy
The safety of our joy:
But let the night be calme and quietsome,
Without tempestuous storms or sad afray:
Lyke as when Jove with fayre Alcmena lay,
When he begot the great Tirynthian groome:
Or lyke as when he with thy selfe did lie,
And begot Majesty.
And let the mayds and yongmen cease to sing:
Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.

Let no lamenting cryes, nor dolefull teares,
Be heard all night within nor yet without:
Ne let false whispers, breeding hidden feares,
Breake gentle sleepe with misconceived dout.
Let no deluding dreames, nor dreadful sights
Make sudden sad affrights;
Ne let housefyres, nor lightnings helpelesse harmes,
Ne let the Pouke, nor other evill sprights,
Ne let mischivous witches with theyr charmes,
Ne let hob Goblins, names whose sence we see not,
Fray us with things that be not.
Let not the shriech Oule, nor the Storke be heard:
Nor the night Raven that still deadly yels,
Nor damned ghosts cald up with mighty spels,
Nor griesly vultures make us once affeard:
Ne let th'unpleasant Quyre of Frogs still croking
Make us to wish theyr choking.
Let none of these theyr drery accents sing;
Ne let the woods them answer, nor theyr eccho ring.

But let stil Silence trew night watches keepe,
That sacred peace may in assurance rayne,
And tymely sleep, when it is tyme to sleepe,
May poure his limbs forth on your pleasant playne,
The whiles an hundred little winged loves,
Like divers fethered doves,
Shall fly and flutter round about your bed,
And in the secret darke, that none reproves,
Their prety stelthes shal worke, and snares shal spread
To filch away sweet snatches of delight,
Conceald through covert night.

506,Prosopopoia: or Mother Hubbard's Tale,"By that he ended had his ghostly sermon,
The fox was well induc'd to be a parson,
And of the priest eftsoons gan to inquire,
How to a benefice he might aspire.
""Marry, there"" (said the priest) ""is art indeed:
Much good deep learning one thereout may read;
For that the ground-work is, and end of all,
How to obtain a beneficial.
First, therefore, when ye have in handsome wise
Yourself attired, as you can devise,
Then to some nobleman yourself apply,
Or other great one in the worldes eye,
That hath a zealous disposition
To God, and so to his religion.
There must thou fashion eke a godly zeal,
Such as no carpers may contrare reveal;
For each thing feigned ought more wary be.
There thou must walk in sober gravity,
And seem as saint-like as Saint Radegund:
Fast much, pray oft, look lowly on the ground,
And unto every one do courtesy meek:
These looks (nought saying) do a benefice seek,
But be thou sure one not to lack or long.
And if thee list unto the court to throng,
And there to hunt after the hoped prey,
Then must thou thee dispose another way:
For there thou needs must learn to laugh, to lie,
To face, to forge, to scoff, to company,
To crouch, to please, to be a beetle-stock
Of thy great master's will, to scorn, or mock.
So may'st thou chance mock out a benefice,
Unless thou canst one conjure by device,
Or cast a figure for a bishopric;
And if one could, it were but a school trick.
These be the ways by which without reward
Livings in court be gotten, though full hard;
For nothing there is done without a fee:
The courtier needs must recompensed be
With a benevolence, or have in gage
The primitias of your parsonage:
Scarce can a bishopric forpass them by,
But that it must be gelt in privity.
Do not thou therefore seek a living there,
But of more private persons seek elsewhere,
Whereas thou may'st compound a better penny,
Ne let thy learning question'd be of any.
For some good gentleman, that hath the right
Unto his church for to present a wight,
Will cope with thee in reasonable wise;
That if the living yearly do arise
To forty pound, that then his youngest son
Shall twenty have, and twenty thou hast won:
Thou hast it won, for it is of frank gift,
And he will care for all the rest to shift,
Both that the bishop may admit of thee,
And that therein thou may'st maintained be.
This is the way for one that is unlearn'd
Living to get, and not to be discern'd.
But they that are great clerks, have nearer ways,
For learning sake to living them to raise;
Yet many eke of them (God wot) are driven
T' accept a benefice in pieces riven.
How say'st thou (friend), have I not well discourst
Upon this common-place (though plain, not worst)?
Better a short tale than a bad long shriving.
Needs any more to learn to get a living?""

""Ye a great master are in your degree:
Great thanks I yield you for your discipline,
And do not doubt but duly to incline
My wits thereto, as ye shall shortly hear.""
The priest him wish'd good speed, and well to fare:
So parted they, as either's way them led.
But th' ape and fox ere long so well them sped,
Through the priest's wholesome counsel lately taught,
And through their own fair handling wisely wrought,
That they a benefice 'twixt them obtained;
And crafty Reynold was a priest ordained,
And th' ape his parish clerk procur'd to be.
Then made they revel rout and goodly glee;
But, ere long time had passed, they so ill
Did order their affairs, that th' evil will
Of all their parish'ners they had constrain'd;
Who to the Ordinary of them complain'd,
How foully they their offices abus'd,
And them of crimes and heresies accus'd,
That pursuivants he often for them sent;
But they neglected his commandement.
So long persisted obstinate and bold,
Till at the length he published to hold
A visitation, and them cited thether:
Then was high time their wits about to geather.

Wafted from mothers that of old have wept.
All souls of children taken as they slept
Are your companions, partners of your ease,
And the green souls of all these autumn trees
Are with you through the silent spaces swept.
Your virgin body gave its gentle breath
Untainted to the gods. Why should we grieve,
But that we merit not your holy death?
We shall not loiter long, your friends and I;
Living you made it goodlier to live,
Dead you will make it easier to die.

With you a part of me hath passed away;
For in the peopled forest of my mind
A tree made leafless by this wintry wind
Shall never don again its green array.
Chapel and fireside, country road and bay,
Have something of their friendliness resigned;
Another, if I would, I could not find,
And I am grown much older in a day.
But yet I treasure in my memory
Your gift of charity, your mellow ease,
And the dear honour of your amity;
For these once mine, my life is rich with these.

Eternity hath borrowed that delight.

There all my loves are gathered into one,
Where change is not, nor parting any more,
Nor revolution of the moon and sun.

Falls not too soon, but lays its flower-crowned head

Against the current of obscure Arno ...

Between the day and the night;
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.

A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches
Where light pushes through;
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.
A dip to the water.

And you think:
""The swallows are flying so late!""

Swallows?

Dark air-life looping

Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,
And falling back.

Never swallows!

559,Almond Blossom,"Even iron can put forth,
Even iron.

This is the iron age,
But let us take heart
Seeing iron break and bud,
Seeing rusty iron puff with clouds of blossom.

The almond-tree,
December's bare iron hooks sticking out of earth.

The almond-tree,
That knows the deadliest poison, like a snake
In supreme bitterness.

Upon the iron, and upon the steel,
Odd flakes as if of snow, odd bits of snow,
Odd crumbs of melting snow.

But you mistake, it is not from the sky;
From out the iron, and from out the steel,
Flying not down from heaven, but storming up,
Strange storming up from the dense under-earth
Along the iron, to the living steel
In rose-hot tips, and flakes of rose-pale snow
Setting supreme annunciation to the world.

Nay, what a heart of delicate super-faith,
Iron-breaking,
The rusty swords of almond-trees.

Trees suffer, like races, down the long ages.
They wander and are exiled, they live in exile through long ages
Like drawn blades never sheathed, hacked and gone black,
The alien trees in alien lands: and yet
The heart of blossom,
The unquenchable heart of blossom!

Look at the many-cicatrised frail vine, none more scarred and frail,
Yet see him fling himself abroad in fresh abandon
From the small wound-stump.

Even the wilful, obstinate, gummy fig-tree
Can be kept down, but he'll burst like a polyp into prolixity.

And the almond-tree, in exile, in the iron age!

This is the ancient southern earth whence the vases were baked, amphoras, craters, cantharus, oenochoe, and open-hearted cylix,
Bristling now with the iron of almond-trees

Iron, but unforgotten,
Iron, dawn-hearted,
Ever-beating dawn-heart, enveloped in iron against the exile, against the ages.

See it come forth in blossom
From the snow-remembering heart
In long-nighted January,
In the long dark nights of the evening star, and Sirius, and the Etna snow-wind through the long night.

Sweating his drops of blood through the long-nighted Gethsemane
Into blossom, into pride, into honey-triumph, into most exquisite splendour.
Oh, give me the tree of life in blossom
And the Cross sprouting its superb and fearless flowers!

Something must be reassuring to the almond, in the evening star, and the snow-wind, and the long, long, nights,
Some memory of far, sun-gentler lands,
So that the faith in his heart smiles again
And his blood ripples with that untenable delight of once-more-vindicated faith,
And the Gethsemane blood at the iron pores unfolds, unfolds,
Pearls itself into tenderness of bud
And in a great and sacred forthcoming steps forth, steps out in one stride
A naked tree of blossom, like a bridegroom bathing in dew, divested of cover,
Frail-naked, utterly uncovered
To the green night-baying of the dog-star, Etna's snow-edged wind
And January's loud-seeming sun.

Think of it, from the iron fastness
Suddenly to dare to come out naked, in perfection of blossom, beyond the sword-rust.
Think, to stand there in full-unfolded nudity, smiling,
With all the snow-wind, and the sun-glare, and the dog-star baying epithalamion.

Oh, honey-bodied beautiful one,
Come forth from iron,
Red your heart is.
Fragile-tender, fragile-tender life-body,
More fearless than iron all the time,
And so much prouder, so disdainful of reluctances.

In the distance like hoar-frost, like silvery ghosts communing on a green hill,
Hoar-frost-like and mysterious.

In the garden raying out
With a body like spray, dawn-tender, and looking about
With such insuperable, subtly-smiling assurance,
Sword-blade-born.

Unpromised,
No bounds being set.
Flaked out and come unpromised,
The tree being life-divine,
Fearing nothing, life-blissful at the core
Within iron and earth.

Knots of pink, fish-silvery
In heaven, in blue, blue heaven,
Soundless, bliss-full, wide-rayed, honey-bodied,
Red at the core,
Red at the core,
Knotted in heaven upon the fine light.

Five times wide open,
Six times wide open,

To comfort her when she her house had dight;
Sometime a barley corn; sometime a bean;
For which she laboured hard both day and night

In harvest time whilst she might go and glean;
And where store was stroyed with the flood,
Then well away! for she undone was clean.

Then was she fain to take instead of food
Sleep, if she might, her hunger to beguile.

The winter evening settles down
With smell of steaks in passageways.
Six oclock.
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers from vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps.

And then the lighting of the lamps.

The morning comes to consciousness
Of faint stale smells of beer
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands.

One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.

You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
Of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling.
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the beds edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.

That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six oclock;
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.

I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.

Gathering fuel in vacant lots.",Nature

The sea swept on and cried her old cry still,
Rolling along in dreams from hill to hill.
He fled the persecution of her glory

Their sadness through a hollow, pearly heart;

wrapped your legs with skins, but how that
chill wind broke through sill and jamb.

“If I threw you in the dike,” she says
“you’d drown as fast as anyone else,” done
with this lesson. I remember older cousins,
swimming between my legs, and suddenly I am rising,
their hands grabbing my knees as my balls collide
with the backs of their necks, and they break
the surface, toss me into deeper water, probably
watching to make sure I surface, after they’ve had
some amusement at my struggle.

In wet darkness, I imagine opening
my eyes and mouth, taking water in,
filling my lungs, discovering gills
like Aquaman or Namor, the Sub-mariner.
Knowing I had better odds of dying, face down,
no voice to call out for help, I am
never quite brave enough to try it, not daring
enough, even, to open my eyes when my face breaks
the stillness of river water contained.

But I flip on my back, ears below the surface, listen
to mysteries, breathe shallowly at that level, and float,
wondering what it would be like to glide the depths
on fins, knowing if I were there, I would desire
legs and lungs, and then I fill my chest to capacity,
and dive, loving and begrudging the ache I find there,
the throbbing of my chest begging for release,
and I swim back up, eyes still closed, wondering how
long it will take to find the surface again.",Nature

638,Wheal Emma Leat,"Wheal Emma and Brookwood are abandoned copper mines whose remains are located near Buckfastleigh, within the Dartmoor National Park, an area with a long history of widespread industrial activity. From this one locality, in the second half of the nineteenth century, more than thirty thousand tons of copper ore were raised, processed, and shipped for smelting. In 1859, in order to stabilize and increase the power supply, Wheal Emma Leat (a fifteen-mile-long channel) was cut across moorland and around woodland valleys to transport water from the River Swincombe and to feed the mines by supplementing the Mardle, a tributary of the Dart. Some of this now empty moorland waterway can be walked today on Dartmoor. I am grateful to Kevin and Donna Cox, owners of the Brook Manor estate, for showing my collaborator, Ignacio Acosta, and me over the remains of mine workings on their land.

Widening the plug doorway
on the bob wall left no
surface evidence. The Mardle
has a floodplain fair and wide.
Material would have been
trammed directly, although
blacked ochreous water flows
freely from the collapsed
portal. Humphrey kept Kevin
back when we went into
the near horizontal dark adit

In Brook Wood at the combe
head is a small killas quarry
predating all three setts.
Rent was paid to the Brook Wood
adventurers. Three areas of
dumping partially covered
this crumbled masonry within
woodland of varying density
just south of the tarmac road.
Yet a leat is depicted on the
1886 OS map channeled entirely
in a raised wooden aqueduct.

Then buildings fall into decay
where ivy and tree growth

patches of rhododendron
are seen quite late in the sequence.

for my brothers to sleep. They’d spent the day
sharpening their hooks, repairing the great net,
filling gourds with fresh water. They’d bundled
taro wrapped in leaves sitting below the cross seats.
The bundles and the net would cover me,
especially if I said the chant to slow my movement
and my breathing. The moon became brighter
like a big fish eye as the chant hooked me.

I was holding my grandmother’s hook so tightly
a little cut welled red between my closed knuckles.
“Goodmorning, brothers,” I called and they cussed
and moaned until the next chant took us a further hundred
miles and then another until my chanting made them gasp
as we settled on a patch of ocean black with fish.
They forgave me, not that it matters. I took the bloody hook
and said my business to the ocean. It worked.

649,Letter to My Father,"October 2017

You once said: My reward for this life will be a thousand pounds of dirt
shoveled in my face. You were wrong. You are seven pounds of ashes
in a box, a Puerto Rican flag wrapped around you, next to a red brick
from the house in Utuado where you were born, all crammed together
on my bookshelf. You taught me there is no God, no life after this life,
so I know you are not watching me type this letter over my shoulder.

When I was a boy, you were God. I watched from the seventh floor
of the projects as you walked down into the street to stop a public
execution. A big man caught a small man stealing his car, and everyone
in Brooklyn heard the car alarm wail of the condemned: He’s killing me.
At a word from you, the executioner’s hand slipped from the hair
of the thief. The kid was high, was all you said when you came back to us.

When I was a boy, and you were God, we flew to Puerto Rico. You said:
My grandfather was the mayor of Utuado. His name was Buenaventura.
That means good fortune. I believed in your grandfather’s name.
I heard the tree frogs chanting to each other all night. I saw banana
leaf and elephant palm sprouting from the mountain’s belly. I gnawed
the mango’s pit, and the sweet yellow hair stuck between my teeth.
I said to you: You came from another planet. How did you do it?
You said: Every morning, just before I woke up, I saw the mountains.

Every morning, I see the mountains. In Utuado, three sisters,
all in their seventies, all bedridden, all Pentecostales who only left
the house for church, lay sleeping on mattresses spread across the floor
when the hurricane gutted the mountain the way a butcher slices open
a dangled pig, and a rolling wall of mud buried them, leaving the fourth
sister to stagger into the street, screaming like an unheeded prophet
about the end of the world. In Utuado, a man who cultivated a garden
of aguacate and carambola, feeding the avocado and star fruit to his
nieces from New York, saw the trees in his garden beheaded all at once
like the soldiers of a beaten army, and so hanged himself. In Utuado,
a welder and a handyman rigged a pulley with a shopping cart to ferry
rice and beans across the river where the bridge collapsed, witnessed
the cart swaying above so many hands, then raised a sign that told
the helicopters: Campamento los Olvidados: Camp of the Forgotten.

Los olvidados wait seven hours in line for a government meal of Skittles
and Vienna sausage, or a tarp to cover the bones of a house with no roof,
as the fungus grows on their skin from sleeping on mattresses drenched
with the spit of the hurricane. They drink the brown water, waiting
for microscopic monsters in their bellies to visit plagues upon them.
A nurse says: These people are going to have an epidemic. These people
are going to die. The president flips rolls of paper towels to a crowd
at a church in Guaynabo, Zeus lobbing thunderbolts on the locked ward
of his delusions. Down the block, cousin Ricardo, Bernice’s boy, says
that somebody stole his can of diesel. I heard somebody ask you once
what Puerto Rico needed to be free. And you said: Tres pulgadas
de sangre en la calle: Three inches of blood in the street. Now, three
inches of mud flow through the streets of Utuado, and troops patrol
the town, as if guarding the vein of copper in the ground, as if a shovel
digging graves in the backyard might strike the ore below, as if la brigada
swinging machetes to clear the road might remember the last uprising.

I know you are not God. I have the proof: seven pounds of ashes in a box
on my bookshelf. Gods do not die, and yet I want you to be God again.
Stride from the crowd to seize the president’s arm before another roll
of paper towels sails away. Thunder Spanish obscenities in his face.
Banish him to a roofless rainstorm in Utuado, so he unravels, one soaked
sheet after another, till there is nothing left but his cardboard heart.

I promised myself I would stop talking to you, white box of gray grit.
You were deaf even before you died. Hear my promise now: I will take you
to the mountains, where houses lost like ships at sea rise blue and yellow
from the mud. I will open my hands. I will scatter your ashes in Utuado.",Nature
650,Flight,"It came to pass
that I boarded a plane
and as I edged past the man
in the aisle seat he said
My name is Dov. I knew
you would come.

So Dov came to pass
and then the next thing
came to pass which was
the plane, which fell through the air
so that all felt and understood
the word “slew.”

We held the hands of those
next to us. Dov’s hand. Dov
who knew I would come.
The hand of my son, who said
Hang on, I’ll just finish listening
to this song.

And it came to pass
that in those seconds of fall
we entered the deluge zone

we hadn’t thought before

that couldn’t be said out
loud or even in our quiet
pulpy insides.

We understood
that children sucked life
from their mothers
then led it back in
in mysterious ways.

We understood
that men damaged children
in shocking unspeakable
ways and in quiet
secretive ways and in silence
and murk.

Somehow
dandelions marjoram
thistle and thrush
came to pass.
And a bank teller
named “Snow.”

And then it came to pass
that we turned away
from where we were headed
because the wind there
was too strong
to land safely on one engine.
We turned away
from the wind bothering the trees,
flaying pansies, knocking lemons
one against another;
away from hymns ancient and
modern, from the holes
dug in the garden for kitchen scraps
that resemble graves
prepared for a succession
of small animals.

Away we turned, back
to a runway on which waited
emergency vehicles
and so it came to pass
that we touched ground
whole, feeling lucky
and afraid.

Being out of danger
it came to pass
that we broke the chain of hands
that held us, though not the chain
of thoughts — that held.
And held. And led us
to the tightly fenced park
where bodies lie, decomposing,
terrifying yet natural,
faces slurred into earth,

The pond was thick with weed

the sort of pond anyone would
swim in, but we did — picking and sliding
into the water over the bog and bees,
bees we suddenly noticed were
everywhere, were settling on our hair
as we swam, ducks turning surprised eyes
our way. After twenty years of marriage

658,The truth about Palmerston North,"People like to mock my town, they mock it
for being too provincial and too boring
and it’s true, not much of import happens here
but I don’t mind. Some people say, when they are asked
what they like about Palmerston North,
that you can always find a park and that’s true,
too, you can always find a park just a short walk
from where you want to go, sometimes right outside,
you don’t have to walk at all, you’re right there.
Of course only people who live in New Zealand
mock Palmerston North, as people who live
outside New Zealand know nothing about it.
People who don’t live in New Zealand mock
our entire little country as a 1950s
throwback with honest, rural folk and unspoilt
scenery which isn’t quite true, our scenery
is spoilt from being looked at too often
and freedom campers, they say, are a problem,
but me, I blame dairy cows. When I lived
in the UK people there thought New Zealand
was a state of Australia, and they would
ask me what was coming up on Neighbours,
thinking I had some kind of inside knowledge,
but the truth is I don’t even watch Neighbours
or indeed any soap operas. Actually
the whole Southern Hemisphere is more or less
written off by people who don’t live here,
as somewhere elsewhere, insignificant,
like Palmerston North, where as I said nothing
much happens. And it’s an undeniable
fact that the magazines I subscribe to
come from exotic places that they flaunt
in their titles, magazines like The New Yorker
and London Review of Books and The Paris Review
but not The Palmerston Northerner.
It’s another fact that The Paris Review
isn’t even published in Paris
and has nothing to say about that city
but it has insightful interviews with famous
writers, some of whom I have read. I have been
to Paris and apart from the architecture
and the food and some very fine cemeteries
and of course the language it’s quite like Palmerston
North, though parking is a nightmare. I never
visited the Louvre but one fine afternoon
I went to the Musée d’Orsay which in the opinion
of many educated people really
is just as good if you like Impressionist
and Post-Impressionist art, which I do.
Still it was nice to come home again, home
to Palmerston North, New Zealand, and to see
the good brown Manawatū River moving
sluggishly under the bridge. It’s not the Seine,
but water is water. Paul Celan threw himself —
odd phrase, as if he were both baseball and pitcher —
into the Seine. John Cleese said Palmerston North
is the suicide capital of New Zealand,
yet you don’t hear of people throwing themselves
into the Manawatū, which would be a risky
business, but only because of the effluent
from those dairy cows leaching into the river.
We live on a floodplain, and the river is ever
in our thoughts and sometimes our houses.
At such times we are downcast but we lift up
our eyes unto the hills and the windmills
perched on them that turn and turn. One time
I saw a middle-aged woman in the Plaza,
our only shopping mall, with her head tilted
to where the sky would have been, but for the ceiling
and the mood lighting, a stout middle-aged woman
with black mascara, elegantly dressed,
her wet mouth a dark, soundless O, and the crowd
not unsympathetically parting
and reforming around her — rock in the river —

Skipping down the grandmother sidewalk without stepping on a
             crack

No one to catch it or hold it




No one to pull the light out of the rhododendrons by hand with
             their own hands

Mom calls from the dog run in the backyard

A minor threat

A dog floats by another dog

Put the coffee on I’ll be right in!

A wind from I-5 kicks up her green jogger and there she’s gone

Stuck in a tree

  •


No one to mow the backyard or the front even or take a message

The eels are male then female and back again

They swim under the couch and disappear

The sun goes on despite disappointing coverage and lower fees

Mom does her hair

What would you like to do with this pile of cell phones?

What would you like to eat?




The baby likes dogs and flowers

Bees in the lilac tree have something to say and say it without giving
             away the ending

A yellow retriever mix or black lab or roses

Royal Gold or Ruby Ruby

That lilac tree probly isn’t even a lilac tree probly it’s a bush

Press play

Her little fingers can’t yet work
             a button

  •


Not only a list of ants making its way from a crack in the concrete to
             a scrap in the sink

Flower Carpet Coral or Flower Carpet Pink

But milk in the ground

Babymeal

Something opens in the day and you
             step right through

The ants are interesting they stick together all in a line or a ring
             circling

The rings of  Saturn




Oh look someone picked up the tennis balls and miscellaneous toys
             before plugging in the mower

Or a spaniel or a boxer

No one to pick her up or hold her?

Blight was a word we never used as the roses took or they didn’t

The baby?

Fragrant Cloud Fragrant Plum

The grass is tennis-ball green

  •


But also that deerfly could have been a mosquito just outside the
             service area

I could finally get through to you to reach you!

The tips of its fingers

Paper or plastic?

If you want birds you might try a bird feeder

Just upstream from a gallon of  2% and a yellow pack of American
             Spirits

Stick on your mosquito body or yellow swimsuit
             and swim




But also the kids breathing inside their mammal rooms breathing
             water

Someone left the bougainvillea on all night ditto the humidifier

Same frequency as the rhoddy’s

You could hear it for a long time after

Their dream names Sharpied onto the sides of a white
             plastic bag

I could finally do that

No one has called my cell phone now for hours



  •


Cherry blossoms call to the surface of things that is
             their color

In contrast to almost everything else on the floor

My dream kids shit in buckets

Frogs try to get on them

Who will shoe their pretty little feet who will hold their hands?

This is the earth and sometimes the earth
             changes colors

Now I remember they were horses mulching the backyard




Who will polish their shiny little hooves?

Who will pick them flowers?

A regular morning

You nuzzled open a pile of cherries and there it was the thing we
             always wanted

Whatever that was

A chain link fence goes round and round
             like a song

They sleep standing up in a circle

  •


Dandelions pee in a corner of the yard a kind of Kodak
             yellow

Lamb’s Tongue ditto the Coltsfoot

My horse kids eat something off the ground I can’t quite make out
             some leather fruits and Oh’s

Nosing in the dark

Nosing inside of  holes

Lay their necks across my one neck

Just upstream from a microwave and a tub of  Cool Whip




Noses against the sliding glass door squeak a little at night that is
             their sound

Noses against visitors

Who will mow around their calves?

Mom said she wasn’t sure

Not one memory of a butterfly back there but horseflies somehow in
             the buck grass

Eat the roses

Dig a little hole and get into it

  •


What should I do with their withers and fetlocks what should I do
             with their dressage?

A parade is nice

I shoveled the backyard for a picnic but you could still smell it

The tomatoes almost took ditto
             the basil

Not only today but also tomorrow

Noses in the dark

Manure noses




The day curled up in a cup

A private life you can hear above the washer or was that the mower
             even now it’s two blocks away

Listening is yellow and green

Fish swim in cell phones

Speakers set up thoughtfully throughout the house did you
             notice that?

Skin wings on the back of another animal or person

Eating out a radio

  •


The day curled up in a corner

Butterfly static but harder to hear the closer you are to the window
             isn’t that odd?

Skateboards on the macadam

Switch heel kickflip via a Frontside 180

I couldn’t see the kids before they were born though they threw
             their voices

An earful of leaf  blowers

Then they were here




The day was moving off somewhere
             hard to see

The day was both

Curled up on the couch

At first I thought I could hear them through leaves and understory
             but then I wasn’t so sure

You both do and you don’t

More a davenport than anything else

Just upstream from a can of  lemon Pledge and some Gordon’s

  •


Did I tell you that I watered the cherry tree in the backyard ditto
             the crepe myrtle?

Is that what’s it called?

Talking to maple leaves makes for a nice morning if quiet
             at first and then loud

Day moves toward the door

A box fan instead of air conditioning

I can’t tell their voices apart

Across the dark green lawn something glows is that a glass of milk?




Kids curled up on the coating

An earwig floats by another earwig

The day listens to traffic moving off in two directions at once like
             standing in a spring shower

Flowers appear without warning

And whom do we have to thank for this delicious lunch?

These petits fours?

That one and only glass of milk?

  •


For instance you walk through the room without
             looking up

The door opens out onto central air after all

Light a cigarette in there

Those Chinook and Silverside probly aren’t probly they’re Rainbow
             Trout and Organic Salmon

A spoonful of roe

No place to light your fingers

Or move them back and forth




For instance the phone keeps ringing in the other room

Beneath a tea cozy

Just upstream from a toilet cover and
             a Percocet

More a lilac than anything else

An ant floats by another ant

A lilac tree

But you don’t even know how to have fun anymore you don’t even
             like to do drugs

  •


Sidewalks glint in sun and trees newly opened oh shit I woke up
             with a tension headache!

Pear blossoms

They smell like semen

For instance I look forward to seeing you all day

No place to put our feet up or
             say anything

Blah blah blahblahblah

Quick let’s do it before the kids wake up!




For a long time I would cut the grass in the morning before
             it got too hot

For instance the basil burned ditto the oatmeal

Growing up I never considered a different kind of  life because we
             had television

It doesn’t seem that long ago

A swimming pool in the living room

White reverb

I used to take off fast but now I take off slow

  •


More a migraine than anything else

Something dull in the bushes is that a rabbit?

A dead squirrel whirligigs
             the light

That light was cling-free

For instance a Coke is nice and something to look forward to and
             you can do it by yourself

I think the day knows exactly what it’s doing

Opening a stuck window or collecting a small fee




But also you see something out the window I don’t see

Moss grows you can count on it

Morning dew scratched at the door then cantered away into what
             we’re not sure of

I filtered everything through rain and got what exactly
             more rain?

The good news is ferns

The good news is graffiti

Those peonies probly weren’t even peonies probly they’re dahlias

  •


But also the kids pick flowers if you let them

Some petals are soapy and blow down the street a quick and linty
             pink and white dream

As for TV there’s always perennials

As for day care there’s always the grass

A pile of nachos in the microwave

Just upstream from a car battery and a glass of SunnyD

Benadryl in the grass and grass insects tuning up the tardy afternoon a
             twitchy kickstart




Her sneeze in the puffed-out dandelions his little cough someplace
             else altogether

It’s time for lunch

It’s time for the sun

Just because you carry something from one day to the next it doesn’t
             make all days the same

Everybody out of  the pool!

The regular skimmers are brightly colored and constant

The regular skimmers are chlorined and cousined

  •


Not only recycling but holding hands in a holding pattern the day
             spends outside

Tied up with kitchen twine and stacked neatly by the curb

A cardboard floats by another
             cardboard

The next thing you know the rain has stopped

And starts again before you know it with a drop and a drop and yet
             another drop

A cup of coffee on the counter

The dogs in the backyard in a lather




Just upstream from a VHS player and a bucket of KFC

Stars look down and count the tops
             of our heads

A cell phone tower via a pine tree

The newly emptied mall parking lot via a lake

I got here late

Wildstyle via FatCap along the chain link was red and yellow spray
             roses

The top of my daughter’s head ditto the top
             of my son’s

  •


The afternoon leans toward television and birds

A dream can stay on all morning and does so sticking around for
             drop-off and pickup

Just in time for a quick once-over

The pansies took ditto the ground cover

More an annual than anything else

The top of my daughter’s head is astro fluff in the
             atmosphere

Blue jays on shuffle in the regular trees




For instance bees make their home in the sandbox

Margarine via butter

The sound of the interstate via the sound of the sea

The top of my son’s head is corn silk shot through a cassette deck
             playing early Black Flag

Alone in the kitchen

Mom presses rewind on the microwave

Dogs melt into the linoleum

  •


Not only that but you don’t have to feel bad anymore

Blue jay by blue jay

The birds are real and wait just outside where
             we left them

Just upstream from the new mixed-use building concern and a two-
             liter of  Diet Squirt

Wings in the wallpaper

Wings and glue

I wasn’t going to do it again but maybe you could describe
             the light?




It’s not easy but it’s a little
             easier

Probly those earwigs weren’t even earwigs probly they were rollypollys

Our loved ones are everywhere

Leaves buffeted by the HVAC system

Their names whispered through an intercom in the evergreens

The blue jay’s nesting material was modern and shining recyclables
             reflected on the surface of  the lawn

A twist of  tinfoil in the shape of a swan

  •


A cloud of dryer lint soundproofs the scrape

Open wires braided in a regular fishtail braid or a 6-pack yoke in a
             classic milkmaid

Cotton wool jute and burlap

Feathers from other birds mixed with regular paper
             and fiberglass

Just upstream from a bottle of  Sumatriptan and a case of  bottled
             water

More a grocery list than anything else

A single zigzag




Tinsel blings the classic cup

Leaves repurposed as sanitizer and a kind of traditional blockwood
             painted or flock wallpaper

Banana leaves and artichokes on fast-forward

Cellulose is waterproof

Human hair or horsehair in a perfect carousel

Not only plastic strips but cellophane draped over the vegetation

A cell phone calls from a cornrow

  •


A bird calls from a saucer or plate

A wire hanger hangs in this regular afternoon a kind of dressing
             chair without a seating assignment

Dead twigs dead leaves and dry
             grass

Reclaimed corners

Reclaimed grass

That monoprint of a maple leaf on the platform

A phosphorous updo




For instance neighbor kids find a nest and check on it each morning
             balanced on a pile of chairs

The ground looks up and then returns to whatever it was doing
             before

Curbside check-in for squeakers

Curbside check-in for suet

Broom bristles mop string and
             dental floss

An onion bag in a topknot

That twist of  tinfoil in the shape of a Park-n-Ride

  •


For instance a light applause breaks out over the swing set slide and
             seesaw combo

Did I tell you I aced the bathroom?

A roll of toilet paper

Scotch-Brite and a butter knife

Probly that nest wasn’t even a nest probly it was a regular
             four-in-hand

Warm water white vinegar and Arm & Hammer

An upload of sunlight




For instance butterflies have tongues and hang them out in the day
             to pick up what exactly?

The local station we used to get we don’t get anymore

Voice mail via an otter

A block-graph via a bluebell

Their tongues curl in the light of a flatscreen projecting a host plant and
             a finale

Four long two short

Sip-sipping a hotspot

  •


For instance the grass looks up and then goes back to whatever
             it was doing before

A very heavy rain followed by a very light rain

Did I tell you I replaced everything and
             all at once?

Dog shit in the backyard

The day in a V shape planted in parks parkways and yards or
             seasonally planted around the house

An attachment via an acorn

A chat room via a catkin




If  the day is fernlike and pointed at the ends and irregular or keeled
             as the times and styles change

A four-ring box clutch via a pillbox

A glass organza via a clinkerbell

Those blue jays probly weren’t even blue jays probly they were
             finches

You can’t put the day back together again

A decal of a hawk silhouette

Just upstream from a pair of  headphones and a Stouffer’s

  •


If  the day is tapered twigs leaf stems and a white undersurface
             tolerating the usual errands

A small tree in the shade of a tall tree

An ozone inside a loophole

More a Lean Cuisine than anything else

We let the grass go yellow on purpose and drove straight to the store

My daughter pulls the grass up
             with her fingers

My son uses scissors




If  the day is deciduous and thin with waves at the margins and
             common or common enough

Did I tell you I vacuumed the carpets and dusted
             the picture window?

A picture of what?

An airplane headed in the direction of  the Willamette

Meanwhile the river looks up and then goes back to whatever it was
             doing before

A landing strip via some riprap

Our futures in a bindle

  •


If the day is untidy looking and aromatic with end-leaflets narrowing
             where the sun is lopsided and lobed

I’ll wait outside

We can’t leave the kids in the car anymore

Or wind or cows or people

Schist in your shoes pick up where we left off

A photo-offset of a fern into a
             spreadsheet

The blue flame in the new gas stove has fins




If  the day is irregular on both sides and pebbled or modified by
             acrylics and permanent

Black toner cartridge via a starling

A stop bath via a sparrow

The afternoon clears the table for flowers and more
             television

Not only whatever’s on but a pinnate in the past

More a dinette set than anything else

The day ticking over in the fixer bath

  •


Meanwhile a northern flicker bends a piece of plexiglass into a wind
             chime

Did I tell you I raked the leaves and put them all into a black
             Glad bag?

Meanwhile a black-capped chickadee

One kid asleep upstairs another on the pot

Bird clutter marks the spot

Just upstream from a newly relaxed regulation and the brand new
             Jiffy Lube

A birdbath in a dribble!




A damselfly vacates the day in a blur

A mosquito on a daisy

My daughter looks up and then goes back to whatever it was she was
             doing before

The afternoon divided up into zones

Where her new sounds meanwhile astound the daylight
             on a leaf

An off-brand beetle duct-tapes the water

X’s & O’s

  •


You don’t have to if  you don’t want to

Pink rollers via a ripple

Little white sticks via a balk

Meanwhile a deer tick slides into the very last reserved parking spot

Under arms around the ears back of the knees and
             between the legs

Meanwhile inside a belly button

A pink parking pass flutters between the seat cushions




A speckle-winged quill vacates the day in a blind

More a leftover than anything else

That grass probly wasn’t even grass probly it was a roll of   Diamond Pro
             Fescue or Jade 50

A blue tint ditto a cloud of flies

Meanwhile a regular water strider enamels the edge of a pond
             making room for you and the rest of  the day

A stork inside your mind

Dots and lines    

  •


In other places we felt much the same as we do today only
             more so

Meanwhile a mayfly floats by another mayfly

A hard drive via a hedge

A Bluetooth via a squiggle

Oh look someone remembered to take out the compost

Meanwhile mites in a double clasp and peaked felt number wish you
             well and more

White foam flowers on a polished floor




Who will tape their wings back?

Who will fold their corners?

A common green lacewing has an appointment someplace else
             altogether and will keep it

To a thrip or a honeydew?

A grand tour

Just upstream from a stackable washer/dryer unit and the brand new
             FreshDirect

The loop that keeps happening in the leaf litter

  •


Before you know it that light has changed from checker mallow and
             milkweed to something more en-suite

Whites and sulphurs

Probly that lacewing wasn’t even a lacewing probly it was a green
             smudge

Hey! Hey kids!

Meanwhile a green comma or a common
             ringlet

Their wings are made of cardboard and Reynolds Wrap

A rubber band here a rubber band there




Meanwhile real sunlight sneaks up the wall somewhere between
             butterfly yellow and butterfly brown

Not a dream really just an ordinary afternoon

What color is that goldenrod?

A focal point via a knob

The new streaming service was all aflutter and temporarily
             unavailable

Not only that but a golden hairstreak

One kid on the couch the other in a bole

  •


Just between the dimmer switch and a short circuit of  local or overlit
             fritillaries

Hi-Liter yellow and chisel tipped

A bucket of  honeysuckle

Bring the car around I’ll be right out!

Did I tell you I aced the console with some Orange Glo ditto the late
             afternoon?

They blanket the lawn in summer

A long dash followed by a short dash




Right between a commotion of  track lighting and a dribble of newish
             antibiotics

A newish drop in the bucket

An overflow of stillness and snacks

My son looks up and then goes back to whatever it was he was
             doing before

The day is nonslip and early

A download of nervy and rainbowed fluorescence

A bedhead floats by another bedhead

  •


Just between the newly installed porch floods and a small handful of
             cabbage whites

A vertical frequency to it

A sprinkle of what exactly?

Not only that but our intentions stacked up
             in a swirl

The bunting’s vocals were lip-synced and weird ditto the dishwasher’s

A voice box via a gorge

A yellow Lego on top of a yellow Lego




Right between a semi-transparent aftereffect and a latticed or
             crosshatched bit of fluff

An upgrade via a wrinkle

More a floater than anything else

Probly that bunting wasn’t even a bunting probly it was a Western
             Peewee

We began with sliced apple and later moved on to sunlight

An orangetip on a pincushion

A pip on the carpet

  •


Or an inverted firefly blinking on and off through a drift of dandruff
             flicked off the TV set

A flittery cat’s eye

Yellow green or pale red

Just upstream from a can of  Sea Foam and a bag of Birds Eye Single
             Steamers

An additive combination of  bark dust and
             grade school

Or a perfect glow stick

The tops of trees




Or an elliptical wastebasket where my son might pick out a glow
             worm or a lime green flashlight fish

The day has its limits

For company I had Kafka on my lap

There are all sorts of creatures in the world, I read,

wretched, limited, dumb creatures

Face-to-face with Qolsys,

I peered into the sensors, into the little hole
of the siren, and touched up my lipstick.

Maybe I can ask Dave to come back, I thought,
Dave from Royal Security,

Dave with the smoky brown eyes,
maybe he can help.

I took off my slippers,
my bargain-basement bra, and danced.

Silence. Not even a mechanical cry —
I wondered if the fault were mine.

Maybe I miswired the hard data?
The soft data?

Maybe the poor thing simply had no loins.
I opened the window.

Window opening, said Qolsys
in a low persuasive voice.

Outside there were heavy birds
weighing down the winter trees,

heaps of them in the gloaming, almost purple,
waiting for what, who can say?

I shut the window.
Window closing, said Qolsys.

It was a start, not so very different from others of my species,
narrating events as they happen,

I’m coming,
I’m coming —

I opened the window again,
letting the cold air press across my wrists,

the back of my neck, my lips, hoping
at least the motion detector, inside,

or the birds, outside,
would respond to the scent that pulsed there.

You will not go unsampled! I heard the birds say.
Be mine! I heard the trees say.

I could have shut the window,

like winter lightning,

661,The Seafarer,"May I for my own self song's truth reckon,
Journey's jargon, how I in harsh days
Hardship endured oft.
Bitter breast-cares have I abided,
Known on my keel many a care's hold,
And dire sea-surge, and there I oft spent
Narrow nightwatch nigh the ship's head
While she tossed close to cliffs. Coldly afflicted,
My feet were by frost benumbed.
Chill its chains are; chafing sighs
Hew my heart round and hunger begot
Mere-weary mood. Lest man know not
That he on dry land loveliest liveth,
List how I, care-wretched, on ice-cold sea,
Weathered the winter, wretched outcast
Deprived of my kinsmen;
Hung with hard ice-flakes, where hail-scur flew,
There I heard naught save the harsh sea
And ice-cold wave, at whiles the swan cries,
Did for my games the gannet's clamour,
Sea-fowls, loudness was for me laughter,
The mews' singing all my mead-drink.
Storms, on the stone-cliffs beaten, fell on the stern
In icy feathers; full oft the eagle screamed
With spray on his pinion.
Not any protector
May make merry man faring needy.
This he little believes, who aye in winsome life
Abides 'mid burghers some heavy business,
Wealthy and wine-flushed, how I weary oft
Must bide above brine.
Neareth nightshade, snoweth from north,
Frost froze the land, hail fell on earth then
Corn of the coldest. Nathless there knocketh now
The heart's thought that I on high streams
The salt-wavy tumult traverse alone.
Moaneth alway my mind's lust
That I fare forth, that I afar hence
Seek out a foreign fastness.
For this there's no mood-lofty man over earth's midst,
Not though he be given his good, but will have in his youth greed;
Nor his deed to the daring, nor his king to the faithful
But shall have his sorrow for sea-fare
Whatever his lord will.
He hath not heart for harping, nor in ring-having
Nor winsomeness to wife, nor world's delight
Nor any whit else save the wave's slash,
Yet longing comes upon him to fare forth on the water.
Bosque taketh blossom, cometh beauty of berries,
Fields to fairness, land fares brisker,
All this admonisheth man eager of mood,
The heart turns to travel so that he then thinks
On flood-ways to be far departing.
Cuckoo calleth with gloomy crying,
He singeth summerward, bodeth sorrow,
The bitter heart's blood. Burgher knows not 
He the prosperous man  what some perform
Where wandering them widest draweth.
So that but now my heart burst from my breast-lock,
My mood 'mid the mere-flood,
Over the whale's acre, would wander wide.
On earth's shelter cometh oft to me,
Eager and ready, the crying lone-flyer,
Whets for the whale-path the heart irresistibly,
O'er tracks of ocean; seeing that anyhow
My lord deems to me this dead life
On loan and on land, I believe not
That any earth-weal eternal standeth
Save there be somewhat calamitous
That, ere a man's tide go, turn it to twain.
Disease or oldness or sword-hate
Beats out the breath from doom-gripped body.
And for this, every earl whatever, for those speaking after 
Laud of the living, boasteth some last word,

So that all men shall honour him after
And his laud beyond them remain 'mid the English,
Aye, for ever, a lasting life's-blast,
Delight mid the doughty.
Days little durable,
And all arrogance of earthen riches,
There come now no kings nor Csars
Nor gold-giving lords like those gone.
Howe'er in mirth most magnified,
Whoe'er lived in life most lordliest,
Drear all this excellence, delights undurable!
Waneth the watch, but the world holdeth.
Tomb hideth trouble. The blade is layed low.
Earthly glory ageth and seareth.
No man at all going the earth's gait,
But age fares against him, his face paleth,
Grey-haired he groaneth, knows gone companions,
Lordly men are to earth o'ergiven,
Nor may he then the flesh-cover, whose life ceaseth,
Nor eat the sweet nor feel the sorry,
Nor stir hand nor think in mid heart,

667,The Boley Rodeo,"A collective family myth
passed down across generations
takes on the polished gleam of truth,
and memories become legend.

The legend of black sod-busters
on a piece of red soil they own
in a township of black ranchers.
Their legendary rodeo.

grand entry

Two Stars and Stripes flutter into
the arena, carried by two
men in jeans, red shirts, white Stetsons.
Guiding their horses with left hands,
holding the flagstaffs in their rights,
their backs straight and tall, their faces,
their chestnut faces, beautiful
in the light of the setting sun.

After them, two by two,
banners waving, hooves raising dust,
ride the Horse People of Boley,
a varicolored promenade.
They canter once around the ring,
then they circle into the sky.

mutton busting

In the cluster of five-year-old
contenders wearing life jackets
and bicycle helmets, paper
numbers safety-pinned to their backs,
you line up one by one for a turn
to hang on tight with your legs squeezed
at the sheep’s broad middle, fingers
holding handfuls of deep, warm wool
as the sheep destiny presents
runs you out to cheering applause.
Whether you’ll fall on top of it,
or it on you, you won’t fall far.
You have no front teeth anyway,
and a brown clown gone pick you up.

bareback riding

This horse was bred and born to buck.
He’s a good horse, he’ll give you points.
Gloved hand in the rigging’s handle,
bare brown hand waving in the air,
you whir your spurs at his shoulders
as he leaps, twists, and jolts your bones.
Four seconds or four hundred years.
But if you can get up and slap
the dust off your jeans with your hat,
the future’s eyes, looking at you,
will fill with forevering light:
light that will make generations
of proud brown people remember
the Black Horse People of Boley.

bulldogging

In truth there’s seldom a reason
for a man to wrestle a steer,
unless he’s a real ranch cowboy
dealing with ornery power.
Maybe, while rounding up the herd,
he bumps heads with testosterone,
and it’s testosterone-vs.-
testosterone. Bill Pickett learned,
watching dogs on a Boley ranch,
that sometimes you’ve got to bulldog
a hardhead with a kiss of pain.
Today, you slide from horse onto
the fleeing steer, grab his horns, pull
five hundred pounds of muscle down.

team roping, calf roping, steer roping

Roping always involves a team,
whether it’s two men or women
or one human and one smart horse.
The aim: to bring down and hog-tie
a big scared baby of a calf
or a full-grown and pissed-off steer.
You gallop out swinging your loop
with one hand, the other holding
the slack and the unneeded reins.
You down him with a careful toss,
tie three of his hooves together,
step back with wide arms and a grin.
A rope isn’t always a noose:
ropes in brown hands can be lassos.

saddle bronc riding

It’s not the leather riding gloves
and it’s not the fringed buckskin chaps,
not the worn-in and dusty boots,
not the spurs’ blunted silver stars,
not the 10x wide-brimmed straw hat
(both winged helmet and regal crown):
it’s not clothes that make the cowboy.
It’s something behind a bronzed face,
in the level gaze from dark eyes,
and, of course, it’s heart that puts you,
the reins in one hand, one hand free,
waving with the horse’s rhythm,
your heels spurring from neck to flank,
on this bronc called America.

barrel racing

Thunder explodes out of the chute.
Mane and tail whip in the speed wind,
agile hooves pound a swift tempo
circling around the first barrel.
One hand grips the horn, the other
communicates with the taut reins,
though your thighs give the best guidance,
telling your horse to maneuver
in circles that hug the barrels.
Three barrels, a tight cloverleaf
you gallop through with one joined will.
This contest pits you and your horse
against the clock and your best time.
Sister, your dreadlocks are flying!

pony express

Before telegraph, news traveled
from mouth to ear, from hand to hand.
News arrived old. From sea to sea
took weeks, unless carried by boys
stationed along the stagecoach route
to race a cross-country relay.
Your pulse gallops toward the handoff,
when your teammate takes the baton
and the noise and flurry go on
without you. Your leg run, you and
your horse (your partner, your friend) stand
encompassed in adrenalin,
watching, as the Ancestors must,
unable to help, but cheering.

tennessee walker

Let’s hear it for the barrel men,
for the bullfighters, for the clowns,
for the men on the side ready
to run toward trouble. Give it up
for the musical director
(thanks for the hip-hop, bro!). And for
the announcer and all the folks
cheering in the stands. That baby
wearing a tiny cowboy hat.
That man the same black as his horse,
in that white suit and fedora.
His Tennessee Walker’s proud gait
as he nods to his own rhythm,
tail an ebony waterfall.

bull riding

Boley bulls are bred for bucking,
bred to be mean, to be “Bad Boys.”
They teach you to sit strong, hold on,
and with one hand reach for the sky.
After riding a Boley bull
a cowboy thinks, Hell, I’ve been there.
I’ve held the bull-rope, raked my spurs,
while that bad boy tried to kill me.
A ton of Brahma seeing red
gives you a whole new perspective,
a who-you-think-you-talking-to
fearlessness. You’ve seen the bull’s eye:
you know you can’t die more than once.
You’ve lived through eight Mississippis.",Nature

670,The Wild Common,"[Version 1: 1921]
The quick sparks on the gorse bushes are leaping,
Little jets of sunlight-texture imitating flame;
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:
They are lords of the desolate wastes of sadness their screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rounded on the mournful grass they have bitten down to the quick.
Are they asleep?  Are they alive?  Now see, when I
Move my arms the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick.

The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;
There the lazy streamlet pushes
Its curious course mildly; here it wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes.

Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow,
Naked on the steep, soft lip
Of the bank I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.

What if the gorse flowers shrivelled and kissing were lost?
Without the pulsing waters, where were the marigolds and the songs of the brook!
If my veins and my breasts with love embossed
Withered, my insolent soul would be gone like flowers that the hot wind took.

So my soul like a passionate woman turns,
Filled with remorseful terror to the man she scorned, and her love
For myself in my own eyes' laughter burns,
Runs ecstatic over the pliant folds rippling down to my belly from the breast-lights above.

Over my sunlit skin the warm, clinging air,
Rich with the songs of seven larks singing at once, goes kissing me glad.
And the soul of the wind and my blood compare
Their wandering happiness, and the wind, wasted in liberty, drifts on and is sad.

Oh but the water loves me and folds me,
Plays with me, sways me, lifts me and sinks me as though it were living blood,
Blood of a heaving woman who holds me,
Owning my supple body a rare glad thing, supremely good.

[Version 2: 1928]
The quick sparks on the gorse-bushes are leaping
Little jets of sunlight texture imitating flame;
Above them, exultant, the peewits are sweeping:
They have triumphed again o'er the ages, their screamings proclaim.

Rabbits, handfuls of brown earth, lie
Low-rounded on the mournful turf they have bitten down to the quick.
Are they asleep?  are they living?  Now see, when I
Lift my arms, the hill bursts and heaves under their spurting kick!

The common flaunts bravely; but below, from the rushes
Crowds of glittering king-cups surge to challenge the blossoming bushes;
There the lazy streamlet pushes
His bent course mildly; here wakes again, leaps, laughs, and gushes

Into a deep pond, an old sheep-dip,
Dark, overgrown with willows, cool, with the brook ebbing through so slow;
Naked on the steep, soft lip
Of the turf I stand watching my own white shadow quivering to and fro.

What if the gorse-flowers shrivelled, and I were gone?
What if the waters ceased, where were the marigolds then, and the gudgeon?
What is this thing that I look down upon?
White on the water wimples my shadow, strains like a dog on a string, to run on.

How it looks back, like a white dog to its master!
I on the bank all substance, my shadow all shadow looking up to me, looking back!
And the water runs, and runs faster, runs faster,
And the white dog dances and quivers, I am holding his cord quite slack.

But how splendid it is to be substance, here!
My shadow is neither here nor there; but I, I am royally here!
I am here! I am here! screams the peewit; the may-blobs burst out in a laugh as they hear!

your luxurious philosophy, though one looks forward to a time

who came at me puffed pink in thoughtfulness when what I needed
then as now was a quiet high enough to envision a half-gallon

brick of all-natural vanilla ice cream softening on the hot hood
of an idling cop car: the earliest rivulets, a slow loss of strict
rectangularity, then the wild gliding around on the beautiful bleak

enamel paint job as its sweet fragrance fills the air like a gift
from Madagascar I can breathe. Rapt Cortés transported cuttings
of vanilla across the Atlantic during his plunder of the Aztecs;

the Aztecs themselves fell captive to its magic after vanquishing
its first cultivators the Totonacs, who paid their conquerors tributes
of baskets stacked to heaven with cured vanilla pods like long

sentences of salutiferous essence. This is one of those instances
history likes to push your face into to try to stir your appetite
for cruelty a little, or at least make you covet the perks of it: I too

want vanilla in quantity. I want it all around me, like a fortress
of mellow dangles. It will move with me as I move and it will ward
hateful people off. For centuries Europeans tried to cultivate it

outside its native Mexico and failed. They could get the vine
to flower, but in the absence of ancestral pollinators, specifically
hummingbirds and a stingless bee, the flowers dropped off podless.

Meanwhile, Edmond Albius—born into slavery on an island
east of Madagascar known then as Bourbon, lush French colony

arena-like caldera that holds the record for most rainfall shed
in one location by a single tropical cyclone ever, namely Hyacinthe—

with a bamboo splint the flap of the rostellum dividing the pollen-
heavy male anther from the female stigma in order to rub the pollen
on the stigma’s eager wand. Within weeks the pods had begun

to form and lengthen into joyous beanlike squiggles laden with
tiny seeds like secrets of the universe as Albius at the shore and under
bright southern stars breathed out I hope in a kind of enlargement

akin to liberty from time, so that on that occasion he might feel
briefly as if his own, even as his method of vanilla pollination
belonged first to his master, then Madagascar, and then the world,

with nearly all vanilla produced today as Albius taught us, including
the kind in Breyers since 1866, fourteen years before Albius died
unrecognized, in poverty, in misery to be exact, while everyone white

mother’s malison


The burr of the wind is seeping through the door,
pink stumps of rhubarb are breaking through the soil.
Though it is February I have the mind of autumn.
Though it is February    ...

The upstairs baby is crying through the wall,
the bay tree at the window wagging its branches;
huddles of leaves, the wave of a green hand.
It is February.

You left your imprint on the bed —
I preserve it, light a candle,
sip saltwater to help my body cry.

I have visions of basking sharks,
great slow-moving shadows,
waning moons for tails —
females — come to birth in the Clyde.

I see babies in the night,
their blue-black eyes barely open,
mouths searching for their mother.

There is no hush where you are
but the endless shudder of waves,
thrum of seal and submarine,
the singing of seaweed
     and algae-wrapped stone.

You will never rest, lie still, water blends
into every part of you, your heart engorged,
brain waterlogged, bones —
a creel for the fish.

My William lies dead.
His thick hair floating on the Clyde
is a bouquet of black tulips growing
out of the river.

Who will remember you but the body that birthed you.
Who will remember you but the clouds that swallowed you.
Who will remember you but the moon you threw sticks at.
Who will remember you but your double buried under the apple.

With a torch of burning wood I drain the river.
Who will remember you? Your death is forever.

•

When the time comes
I scratch your name on the back of a stone
and throw it into the Firth.

Because the river is a collector — it gathers relics from the living and the dead.
Because the river carries the elements out to a plastic sea.
Because the river cannot contain the warmth of your rough hands.
Because the river is a hospital corridor, swinging doors without end.

I have seen the rising of the Clyde, waves hurling,
thrashing the road. I have teased them as a girl,
turning as they whip my heels, rain riding my arms.

The Clyde is a dark horse permeating the mind,
carrying off trees, land, the moon,
and my son.

The Firth covered his face, his body sank to the maerl.
But where is he now? — The Kilbrannan Sound.
And now? — The Atlantic.

•

The house is flying around me.

I opened a window and watched him leave.
I ran a bath at the moment of his drowning.

As my body pushed him into this life
so I carried him back over the threshold.

How could I tell him not to go?
How could I tell him I saw it in a dream?

Ally bally, ally bally bee,
sittin’ on yer mammy’s knee

He came to the door like a flood,
the waters rising.

I was caught in the tsunami of a dream
when he came to the door;
     my bed riding the waves.

He came while I was sleeping
though my hair sensed he was near.

In the stranglehold of drugged sleep
     he arrived,
but I could not break free.

•

The Clyde came alive under an orchid moon
     like a thousand white snakes
and caught him by the neck.

Thundering in his ears, burning in his lungs.
               He is searching
for a silhouette on the riverbank
     but finds none.
He is searching for the blood-sun,
     break of dawn —
it does not come.

The sky withdraws like a car reversing
down a street, his arms outstretched
     like an act of supplication.

•

I came to the Gantocks to find you, William,
I followed your footsteps in my mind.
I was caught in the red eye of a beacon, William,
I was caught in a double bind.

•

The Firth and sky meet in smoky blue, light cracking the mist,
the tired body of a pier slumped in the water;
my arm burning from your last touch.

At first the Clyde came up to my ankles,
then to my knees, my chin.

Your hat caught in the wild animal
of a piece of driftwood — with tusks,
a wooden tooth, a wooden tongue.

Fragile ripples now roll into nothing.
I watch a gull rising in you.

You had a witch for a mother, William,
I did too.
          So now together we lie
in Clyde’s water
like brother and like sister.

And we shall sleep in Clyde’s water
like sister and like brother.



mother’s deception


Through a closed door I spoke to him.
Through a closed door he thought I was my daughter.
Through a closed door I sent him away,
told him I had another.

The arms of the rowan are split,
shooting upwards,
they vibrate in the wind like a tuning fork

releasing pure tones
of sine and cosine — high pitched
like a keening mother.

For whom does she cry?
The berries are her daughters.

Plump, mushy hearts, multiplying —
there are so many of them,
each one star-kissed.

I carried a sprig with me —
bent the twigs into the shape of a cross
and sewed them into the lining of her coat.

The coat they found like a dog
washed up on the beach,
bearing no one.

May Margaret, May Margaret,
why did you go?

to the drumming of the crab.
I dress a doll in your baby clothes,

white bonnet, mittens —
sit it on my knee.

  Two large cormorants flew rapidly and very low across the water heading directly towards Langstone Rock, where Dawlish Warren joins the coast just beyond the western edge of the Exe estuary. Their wing tips were almost touching the choppy water. This must have been about 7:45 on Friday morning; I was thirty yards or so out in the sea, only my head visible between the waves that the cormorants flew in among as they powered along one behind the other. I had come down the concrete lifeboat ramp and taken just a few steps on wet sand scattered with various shells, little gleaming stones, and scraps of seaweed, getting quickly into the cool water. The sky was piled up with dark gray cloud overhead but clear and bright at the horizon. The two birds passed close by and continued on their way indifferent to me watching them from the water and they gave no indication if they saw anything unusual.

machine me, you hatch me in. To

702,She Spent a Year Hallucinating Birds,"They perched on roofs and fences and sills. They posed statue-still on catenary lines. They aligned along cables like prayer beads on rope. They amassed en masse on the cemetery lawn and marauded the broad, yawning fields like cattle. Their cackles were black. Each shadow dove and pecked. They nested in chimneys and chirped at the chime of the church bell. They worked in shifts. Clocked out at odd hours. They laid their eggs in the Vs of trees. They teemed on the dry-baked banks of creek beds, streams the sun had overseen. They teetered on the bed-knob tops of flagpoles. They pitched like pennies into founts. They pitched like babies into wells. They thumped at doors then skulked away like hoodlum teens. They jabbed her. When she cried they did it faster. Everyone knows what happened next. Some grew big as sunflower stalks, others tall like bonfire flames. Or moving vans. Or the sick, brick houses people die inside of every night. Their hatchlings canopied the sky. Was it her fault, then, when they pinned her to the ground and thrust their feathers down her throat? Or wormed between her legs in bad-man ways? Or rattled plumes and whooped and beat her body with their wings? Or locked their talons to her thighs and tra-la-la-ed that ditty from the old-time music box? Or forced their whiskies past her lips? Or put her in the pillory? This was foreplay, in a way. They rolled in rabid packs and woofed like dogs. She couldn’t throw a bone. The meat was gone.

704,I Am Chito,"The first time I ever heard about coyotes
Was in a book called (in Japanese) Seton’s Animals for Boys and Girls
There I encountered Lobo the Wolf King, bighorn sheep, a family of wild boars, cottontail rabbits, and raccoons, but it was the stories of the wise coyote I loved the best
I read the book over and over, over and over, it taught me the wisdom of rabbits, wolves, wild boars, but nothing surpassed the wisdom of the coyote
Tito was raised by humans, was kept constantly on a leash
No one loved her, they teased her until she ran away
She learned to survive
Ran for her life with her pups in her mouth
Trying to get away from dogs and people
I read about her over and over, over and over
There was a map of America in the front of the book with pictures of animals where the stories took place: coyotes in the central plains, wolves in the southwest and north, elsewhere there were cottontails, boars, and partridges
During my childhood, that was America to me
Where did that book go? I no longer live in my childhood home, not even in the same town, not even in the same country, I lost my place there, I lost people and relationships, almost lost others too, I lost my language, but what about that book I read over and over, over and over? I must have lost it too

Just the other day
I tried searching for it on Amazon
It popped right up, and I ordered it straight away
Lives of the Hunted it’s called in English
Published in 1901, reprinted in 1967
It arrived at my home
A former library copy, the word discard stamped on it in big letters, probably the library didn’t want it because the stories are too cruel, too cruel for today’s youth, nowadays kids are used to killing one another in the virtual world, but even so, the stories are too cruel, a mother coyote was giving her cubs her milk, was licking them when hunters shot her dead, her cubs fled into their den, only to be dragged out one by one
Here is how the book describes it:
Even at this age there was a certain individuality of character among the puppies. Some of them squealed and some of them growled when dragged out to die. One or two tried to bite. The one that had been slowest to comprehend the danger, had been the last to retreat, and so was on top of the pile, and therefore the first killed. The one that had first realized the peril had retreated first, and now crouched at the bottom of the pile. Coolly and remorselessly the others were killed one by one, and then this prudent little puppy was seen to be the last of the family. It lay perfectly still, even when touched, its eyes being half closed, as, guided by instinct, it tried to “play possum.” One of the men picked it up. It neither squealed nor resisted.
Neither squealed
Nor resisted ...
The book was in English, but I could read it quickly
Since I remembered the Japanese
I had read the book over and over, over and over
All the coyote pups were killed
Only one survived, only a single pup
Tossed with its dead littermates into a sack and taken to a farm
In the original, the hunters named her Tito
That’s what I had suspected, I had read it in an old translation, kids in Japan back then couldn’t be expected to pronounce the unfamiliar sound ti, but that’s the version I was brought up on
So for me, her name was always Chito
I was always Chito

Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-w-o-o-o-o-o-o-w
I remember her voice
When I was a child, I read the book over and over, over and over
Here is how the book describes it:
an inborn hankering to sing
Her songs were
a volley of short barks
mixed with doleful squalls —
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-w-o-o-o-o-o-o-w
Here is how the book describes it:
when the sun went down she would feel the impulse to sing that wild song of the West which means so much to the Coyotes. It is not the invention of an individual nor of the present, but was slowly built out of the feelings of all Coyotes in all ages.
I’m not sure if I remember the Japanese correctly
Getting old is no fun at all, you forget important things like that
It is not the invention of an individual nor of the present,
but was slowly built out of the feelings of all Coyotes in all ages and
Her experiences all emphasized for her that old idea to “lay low”—
that is, to be quiet, unobtrusive, and hide when danger is in sight
Those were the most important things I learned as a child
Chito’s wisdom
How to survive
Seeing the book, I remembered why
I came to this place called America
The most important things I learned as a child
Were in that book I read over and over
Maybe I had lost them for a while
Or just forgotten
The fate of the animals, their lives and deaths
Their lives upon the plains, and my life too
Chito was killed over and over again
But each time she came back to life
The humans tenaciously, persistently killed her
She tricked them and was tricked by them in return
She scattered her feces, went into heat
The more they hunted her
The more clearly things came into focus
In other words, all the things she thought along the way
Not the invention of an individual nor of the present
But slowly built out of the feelings of all coyotes in all ages
It was for Chito
For Chito
That I abandoned my home, bought an airline ticket
And came to this place
There was someone I barely knew, I’d only barely caught his scent
But still I followed my nose and pursued him
I found a room, rented a car
And stayed the full three months permitted without a visa, I thought I’d try to stay
When people asked me why I’d come, I said
I’m a poet, I’ve come to learn about the oral traditions of the Native Americans
And that was true
But I didn’t even know what I wanted to know
I didn’t know where to go
I didn’t know whom to ask
I was terrible at speaking with people in my native tongue, so in English it was damn near impossible, I couldn’t even tell them who I am (it took me decades to say that even in Japanese)
But the real reason I came
Was because I wanted to encounter a coyote
I wanted to prick up my ears and listen to its howl
Rattling dryly over the roads, through the darkness of night

705,How They Speak of the Fields,"For Timothy Yu
For us. They say:

just dig your hands

into the good, good

soil of the field


and you will grow into a child

of our heart. Be quiet

and work, for you are good

at it, for you are almost

a child of our heart

already. Listen


and we will reward

you. We will reward

you, but don’t talk


— you will want to

have earned the

reward. We will

reward you later, much,

much later. Are you not


a child of the field, a child

native to the field?


But I have never seen

the field. I was born

in it but squeezed

my eyes shut. I squeezed


my eyes hard shut

so I could imagine

another field....",Nature
706,Rhapsody on a Windy Night,"Twelve o'clock.
Along the reaches of the street
Held in a lunar synthesis,
Whispering lunar incantations
Dissolve the floors of memory
And all its clear relations,
Its divisions and precisions,
Every street lamp that I pass
Beats like a fatalistic drum,
And through the spaces of the dark
Midnight shakes the memory
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.

Half-past one,
The street lamp sputtered,
The street lamp muttered,
The street lamp said, ""Regard that woman
Who hesitates towards you in the light of the door
Which opens on her like a grin.
You see the border of her dress
Is torn and stained with sand,
And you see the corner of her eye
Twists like a crooked pin.""

The memory throws up high and dry
A crowd of twisted things;
A twisted branch upon the beach
Eaten smooth, and polished
As if the world gave up
The secret of its skeleton,
Stiff and white.
A broken spring in a factory yard,
Rust that clings to the form that the strength has left
Hard and curled and ready to snap.

Half-past two,
The street lamp said,
""Remark the cat which flattens itself in the gutter,
Slips out its tongue
And devours a morsel of rancid butter.""
So the hand of a child, automatic,
Slipped out and pocketed a toy that was running along the quay.
I could see nothing behind that child's eye.
I have seen eyes in the street
Trying to peer through lighted shutters,
And a crab one afternoon in a pool,
An old crab with barnacles on his back,
Gripped the end of a stick which I held him.

Half-past three,
The lamp sputtered,
The lamp muttered in the dark.

The lamp hummed:
""Regard the moon,
La lune ne garde aucune rancune,
She winks a feeble eye,
She smiles into corners.
She smoothes the hair of the grass.
The moon has lost her memory.
A washed-out smallpox cracks her face,
Her hand twists a paper rose,
That smells of dust and old Cologne,
She is alone
With all the old nocturnal smells
That cross and cross across her brain.""
The reminiscence comes
Of sunless dry geraniums
And dust in crevices,
Smells of chestnuts in the streets,
And female smells in shuttered rooms,
And cigarettes in corridors
And cocktail smells in bars.""

The lamp said,
""Four o'clock,
Here is the number on the door.
Memory!
You have the key,
The little lamp spreads a ring on the stair,
Mount.
The bed is open; the tooth-brush hangs on the wall,
Put your shoes at the door, sleep, prepare for life.""

The last twist of the knife.",Nature
707,Repose of Rivers,"The willows carried a slow sound,
A sarabande the wind mowed on the mead.
I could never remember
That seething, steady leveling of the marshes
Till age had brought me to the sea.

Flags, weeds. And remembrance of steep alcoves
Where cypresses shared the noons
Tyranny; they drew me into hades almost.
And mammoth turtles climbing sulphur dreams
Yielded, while sun-silt rippled them
Asunder ...

How much I would have bartered! the black gorge
And all the singular nestings in the hills
Where beavers learn stitch and tooth.
The pond I entered once and quickly fled
I remember now its singing willow rim.

And finally, in that memory all things nurse;
After the city that I finally passed
With scalding unguents spread and smoking darts
The monsoon cut across the delta
At gulf gates ... There, beyond the dykes

I heard wind flaking sapphire, like this summer,
And willows could not hold more steady sound.",Nature
