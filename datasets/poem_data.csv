ask Farooq if you need a hint. the brain is full of magic

there’s a team of writers who decide who wins and who loses.
the metaphor is obvious. my mom wasn’t born to play the role
of mom, i don’t care how many baby dolls she played with.

don’t grow without pricked hands.
i didn’t have to spend a summer in a freezer
packing lunch meat to know the value
of sunlight. my mom didn’t have
to spend a decade wiping down floors to appreciate
education. when i give you a bouquet of roses,
i give you a bouquet of bloody hands.
a handful of dirt & the worms that doted on your roses.
when i take my piece of sky out of the bank,
it’s smaller. the drunks are right about moonshine.

Psalm,"I amuse myself with my country.
     I glimpse its future approaching on the eyelashes of an ostrich, I toy with its history and its days, I strike it with stones and thunderbolts. I extinguish its lamps and light its windows, and at the other end of day I inaugurate its history.

I am a stranger to all of you. I am from the other end. I live in a country of my own, inflating the sky to see its ashes, and in sleeping and waking I open a bud to live within.

Something must be born, so I bore caverns in my skin for lightning and build nests. I must pass like thunder into lips as sad as straw, between stone and autumn, between pore and epidermis, between thigh and thigh.
      And so I sing: “Form worthy of our demise—advance.”
     And so I shout and sing: “Who will give us the maternity of the cosmos, who will nourish us with mines?”

I advance toward my self, toward ruins. The silence of calamity takes me—I’m too short to gird the earth like a rope, I’m not sharp enough to pierce the face of history and plunge in.

You want me to be like you. You boil me in the cauldron of your prayers; you mix me with the broth of armies and the pepper of tyrants, then pitch me like a tent for the wali and hoist my skull like a flag.
     (My death,
     Nevertheless I run toward you, I rush rush rush to you.)

You live like flagstones, and lamentation is your air. You announce the hedgehog’s abode and sleep on the scarab’s censers—your children are immolations.

A distance as great as a mirage divides us.

I rouse hyenas in you, I rouse the gods. I sow sedition in you and suckle fever, then teach you to journey without a guide. I am a pole for your latitudes and a walking springtime. I am a convulsion in your throats, a hemorrhage in your words.


You advance like leprosy toward me, and I am the one bound to your dirt. Yet nothing unites us, everything divides us—so let me burn alone, let me pass through you like a spear of light.
     I cannot live with you, I cannot live without you. You are an undulation in my senses, and I cannot escape you. Even so, cry out, “The sea, the sea!” Even so, hang the beads of the sun on your thresholds.

Open my memory and study my face beneath its words, learn my alphabet. When you see foam weaving my flesh and stone flowing in my blood, you will see me.
      I am closed like a tree trunk, present and ungraspable like air. Thus I cannot surrender to you.

I was born in the sockets of lilacs, I grew in the orbits of lightning, I live with light and grass. I storm and I clear up, I shine and cloud over, I rain and snow—the hours are my language, and my country is day.

The people are sleeping, but if they die they’ll awaken, or so it was said. You are all sleeping, but if you awaken you’ll die, or so it shall be said.
     You are dirt on my windowpanes, and I must remove you. I am the coming morning and the map that draws itself.

Nevertheless, there’s a fever in my bowels that keeps vigil over you.
     Nevertheless, I await you,
     In the shell of night by the sea, in the roaring of the depths, in the holes in the robe of the sky, in the jujubes and acacias, in the pines and cedars, in the hearts of the waves, in the salt,
      I await you.

Sestina in Prose,"It was like climbing a mountain to those of us who’d climbed one. To the others, it was like, I suppose, something else. In other words, we let everybody find her own figure of speech.

Not that it—speech—lay thick on the ground, or mountain; it presented itself one word at a time, far between. A body had to keep an eye out, like for firewood at dusk, or else

miss her chance. Nobody else, let’s face it, cared about metaphor, or even simile, the like-it-or-not-ness of the mountain pretty much getting between a body and her musing, in its going. One

step at a time, anyone could lose herself or someone else just staring at her feet. And if a body meet a body is not mere speech but something that could happen, like hopping a bus—though on the mountain

you’ll catch no rides, worse luck, the mountain requires to be climbed on foot, one after the other, nothing else will get you up it. There’s nothing like such obduracy but in the wild, nobody can tell you otherwise. No simple figure,

A Vision,"Our city fled,
So I sought its paths in haste
And looked around—I saw only horizon,
And I perceived that those who flee tomorrow
And those who return tomorrow
Are a body I tear apart on my page.

I could see: the clouds were a throat,
The water formed walls of flame.
I saw a sticky yellow thread,
A thread of the history that clings to me.
A hand mulls over my life, ties my days together
Time and again, a hand that was heir
To the race of dolls and the progeny of rags.

I entered the rites of creation
In the waters’ womb and the trees’ virginity,
I saw trees seducing me,
I saw rooms among their branches,
Beds and windows resisting me,
I saw children and read them
My sand, I read them
Suras of clouds and verses of stone,
I saw them journeying with me,
I saw pools of tears and the corpse of rain
Gleaming behind them.

Our city fled—
What am I? A spike of grain
Weeping for a lark
That died beneath the snow and cold,
Died without revealing its messages,
Died without writing anyone.
I questioned it and saw its corpse
Discarded at the end of time,
And I cried out, “Silence of the ice, I
Am the home of the exiled lark.
Its grave is my home, and I’m an exile.”

Our city fled,
And I saw my feet transform
Into a river overflowing with blood,
Into ships growing distant, expanding,
And I saw my drowned shores seducing ...
My waves were wind and pelicans.

Our city fled,
And refusal is a crushed pearl
Whose powder anchors my ships,
And refusal is a woodcutter living
On my face—it gathers me and sets me on fire—
And refusal is the distance that disperses me.
I see my blood and I see my death
Beyond my blood:
It speaks to me and pursues me.

Our city fled,
And I saw how my shroud illumines me,
I saw ... If only death would grant me time.

Why I Am Not a Sculpture,"To be a statue               carved by Bernini
Lounging in a climate-controlled museum in Rome         is luxury
Like the luxury of a personal pan pizza            with unlimited free toppings
Or the luxurious feel of a premium eye pencil          used to draw bisons on the walls of a French cave
To be so white and glossy                   is unimaginable
Like how I imagine a plate of eggs painted by Velázquez           or the lid of a designer toilet cistern
In a European magazine                       (I could be European
And wear a dashingly arranged scarf          or sip weirdly-named liqueurs that taste like semen
In a Rococo palais)                but in the scheme of things
Where I am marble and still                  my wrist will be a marvel
Like the marvel of an isthmus           whose name can only be pronounced if you have a lisp
Or the marvelous sausage                that saved a man from the Inquisition in 1582
It is definitely marvelous                    to be as attenuated
As the casually extended leg of a greyhound                   reclining on its very own velvet settee

The way a designer toilet cistern is admired               or a piece of elaborate pâtisserie
(Although I am not a statue                   I have often held my arms aloft
As when catching a carelessly thrown baby              or pointing at two meteors at the same time)

Woodcut,"The trouble with Jane Eyre
isn’t what I thought when I slammed shut the book
on those pictures trying to fly out at me
because I misunderstood, being too young

to read. When you’re unable to read a book
you can’t understand the illustrations either.
Those were my mother’s books, a green bound set
of that one and the book by her sister, Emily.

When you can’t understand the artwork
the face at the window is a monster.
It is only Cathy, though, in the book by Brontë’s sister,
calling for her lover. And the awful figure bending

over Jane’s bed with the candle, that monstrous
creature—well, there are flaws in the mind of Jane, too,
and the awful figure bending over her
might be the tormented wife of Rochester.

There’s a flaw in Jane’s mind, too,
looking down on the young French child
born to another tormented mother
whom Rochester says has inherited sin.

The young French child likes presents too much,
likes to dance and sing—and so what? She is love-starved,
this child who has supposedly inherited sin,
who will never get the approval of Mr. Rochester.

We lose track of the pretty child who likes to sing.
Jane goes away for a while to prove her purity.
Then, when the other wife dies, Mr. Rochester
will approve. Reader, I married him, she says,

after she has gone away for a while. He is blind
from the fire the crazy wife set. And then, miraculously,
her love asks if she is wearing a blue dress.
I believe she is pregnant, then, carrying a child

who will be a good child, miraculously.
Charlotte Brontë knew only part of the happy ending.
Perhaps he gets better and sees the blue dress.
We have to believe things turn out well,

while Charlotte, herself, had nine months of pleasure
and died. And so the book, which ends as if resolved,
asks us to believe things turn out well, the French girl gone,
Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out

mansion, because books then ended resolutely
and did not reflect how it is to have a calm life,
Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out
mansion, illustrated by the art of the woodcut,

which does not suggest such a calm life,
but a knife and fire making art out of wood,
in a mansion that itself has been sculpted by
fire and breaking things, which is how we really live.",Art and Science
The Wound,"1

The leaves sleeping beneath the wind:
A vessel for the wound.
Time perishing: the glory of the wound.
The trees rising among our lashes:
A lake for the wound.

The wound lies in bridges
When the grave lengthens,
When patience stretches
Between the banks of our love and death.
The wound, a gesture, is passing.

2

I give the voice of the wound
To the tongue of strangled bells,
To stone approaching from afar,
To aridity and the arid land,
To time borne on a stretcher of ice,
I kindle the fire of the wound.

When history burns in my garments,
When blue nails sprout in my book,
When I shout during the day,
Who are you? Who’s thrusting you
Into my notebooks,
Into my virgin earth?
In my notebooks, in my virgin earth,
I glimpse two eyes of dust
And hear someone say,
“I am the wound that grows
In your narrow history.”

3

I named you cloud,
Wound, dove of departure,
I named you quill and book.
And here I am, starting a dialogue
Between myself and the drowned tongue
On the isles of exodus,
On the archipelago of the ancient fall.
And here I am, teaching the dialogue
To the wind and palms—
Wound, dove of departure.

4

Had I a harbor, had I a vessel
In the land of dreams and mirrors,
Had I the remains
Of a city, had I a city
In the land of children and weeping,

I would forge them all for the wound
Into a spear-like song
That pierces trees and stones and sky,
A song as supple as water,
Unruly and dazed, like conquest.

5

World adorned with dreams and yearning,
Rain down on our deserts,
Rain down, but shake us, palms of the wound,
And break two branches off for us
From the trees that love the silence of the wound,
From the trees with arched lashes and hands
That keep vigil over the wound.

World adorned with dreams and yearning,
World falling in my brow,
Drawn like the wound,
Come no closer—the wound is closer than you.
Don’t tempt me—the wound is more beautiful,
And the wound has passed by that enchantment
Cast by your eyes
In the last kingdoms,
Passed without leaving a sail to tempt it astray,
Without leaving it an island.

Awl,"A tool for piercing holes. Particularly in leather. A simple metal shaft. A knob of wood for handle, polished by its fit in the sinewy cradle of a leather-worker’s palm. Likely the tool with which Louis Braille blinded himself as a child in France. An accident in his father’s saddle-making shop in the early years of the nineteenth century. Braille later invented a system of raised dots as a means of reading and writing for the blind. We don’t know much. Whether he was in the shop with his father or snuck in alone. Whether it was damp and rainy or whether the sun shone and brought to life the floating dust that always hung in the workshop air. Maybe it was just a little poke in the eye. A small tool, a small slip of the hand, a small injury. How a little fumble ends in blindness. It was decades before general anesthetic or antiseptics. Perhaps the doctor they rushed him to believed in the value of “laudable pus” in a wound. I don’t want to picture it. As a child, playing in his father’s saddle-making shop, did Louis Braille already know the names of the parts of a saddle—cantle, pommel, stirrup, tree? Did he know the smell and feel of each grade of leather? Of all the tools—punch and pincers, gouge and groover, chisel and awl—he chose awl. Likely the last thing he saw, a shine of metal galloping toward his eye. Is it accident that my tool for pressing hand-punched Braille is so much like a blunt, very small awl?",Art and Science
The Binchōtan Charcoal & Its Ash,"There is no delusion that she wants her.
Is marriage like owning a very expensive art piece?

Your spouse the painting?
You the crooked frame that won’t fit?

Is this how desire is born?
From having less or from wanting more?

She wakes up calling her name.
She wakes up knowing that she doesn’t want less.

From House of Cards she learned a new rule: “I love that
woman. I love her more than sharks love blood.”

Or something along that line. She may have misquoted.
It came out of the pre-disgraced Kevin Spacey’s mouth.

Her God doesn’t exercise telepathy or residence.
Hands, eyes, mouths, authenticity.
It’s a city without mirrors.
Because touch, in itself, is symmetry.

She held the woman’s face in her mind’s eye &
realized that they would never be lovers &
as soon as she let her go, mosses grew all over
the geography of her hands and the woman’s face.

Is this because it’s a debt that must be paid for
not believing in somebody?
In herself?

She felt the desire of desire as if it was a binchōtan

On Easter Sunday, she sang a Christmas carol of Lao Tzu.
Lao Tzu, where is your power to persuade a tree from falling
asleep on itself?

Does night dream of actresses sleeping on leaves?
Where is the human figure in this?

Your Saturday is a memory without a body.
A pair of lungs that knew too much about your mother’s rape
tells you to leave reality through a threshold of a dream.

You knew how to be authentic. How to get rid of people.
How desertion works in the wilderness.
You exclude sound from your thesis.
It’s a way for you to desert poetry without being too poetic.

There were thistles inside of your mother’s vaginal canal.
She wasn’t violated in the wilderness. He has dragged her there to
say that it was okay to want pins and needles. She wasn’t numbed

Lao Tzu.

In a remote mountain, the men are smoking pipes and their vapors
smell like evergreen.

To punctuate their desire she says: God is being difficult. But he is
not.

I have to tell the world that I am sad and have been forgotten. Is
there a way home from not being homeless? Is there a way to swim

of your mother’s scream.
When it was hoarse, it had the shape of a small bonsai tree.

Your cat licks you and licks you.

You know it’s not 300 bc.
Desire comes and goes while leaving lies to clothe themselves.

Her anger is a troublesome candidate of sadness—
lights itself on fire.
From time to time, the cunt of that fire grows ember by ember.

Once in a while, a house made of screams floats down a black river
on the planet Pluto.
Its chimney is not designed to ventilate silence or resilience.
It’s designed to allow screams to escape without suffocating
everyone inside it.

Once in a while the rain arrives to suppress the anger of the
scream.

When anger soaks like wet grasses on the house’s floorboard, the
ants come out to showcase their military might.

Cell,"The blood of language moves through the word cell from monk’s cell to prison cell to biological cell. I don’t know why a Braille cell is called a cell. I don’t know how many blood cells Louis Braille lost when the awl he was playing with as a small child slipped and injured his eye.

Red blood cells live some hundred days before they are worn out by their silent hustle—looping and looping, pounded through the heart’s chambered cathedral, rushing out to the farthest reaches of the body with the good news of oxygen, squeezing single file along capillaries, like anxious deer probing their tracks through the woods. Rushing, silent, looping the circuits of the body. Again, again, again. Load iron. Dump iron. Load dump squeeze hustle.

Red blood cells pushed through the capillaries that pushed through my retinas. They broke loose to run a green swarm in the corral of my eye. But that is history. Today cells still push through the capillaries fenced off by my calloused fingerprint. This one that I run over the Braille cell, the pattern of bumps.

—

A red blood cell is measured in microns. A solitary prison cell is measured in feet. Six feet by nine feet or less. I don’t know what the unit of measure is for how living in solitary changes a person. We know that living in a confined space, without access to the long view or landscape, changes the eye. The eye, for lack of practice, loses its ability to make out what lies in the distance. I don’t have a unit of measure for what this does to the heart.

—

A Braille cell is measured in spaces in a grid—two across by three down—that can be filled with a raised dot or bump. Different combinations of dots represent different letters, punctuation, symbols, shorthand.

—

The oldest cell I find in the dictionary is the monastic cell, a place for contemplation. From the concealed place where wine was stored. As in cellar. I find Braille contemplative. I touch my index finger to a bumpy piece of paper. My hand advances slowly left to right, the touch receptors in my finger triggered by the uneven contact of paper and skin. Messages run along nerves, finger-to-brain, brain-to-finger. Cognition sizzles. Mind notices this feels different than the pathway of sound in ear to auditory processing. Listening pulls me out into the world in an infinity of directions. Touching my reading educates me on my exact location in the world, feet in shoes, weight of foot on ground, weight of bones and flesh in chair.",Art and Science

Our earth can’t live without holy rites.
You can see this from the sky.

Lots of hills to climb up and down.
A straight ravine between.

Snow figures engraved in stones.
Show streaks of sun gone but
The white rocks shrink and grow
Grave at sunset.



Turn to the right
And you will fall to the left.

One figure wears a beard
Down to his chest

But Eros hates coverings.
And prefers to be caught naked

With his bow and arrow.

But clears the way for pathos.

From above I covet a mountain beneath my feet.

Shrines made of dung and branches,
With berries for eyes and burlap hung with holly.
They were curled in shadows on roads
Leading to every stop we made from the Trig

To Top Withens to Liverpool.
The white and purple mountains.
Stood over the Brontës and clusters
Of black thistles’ script.

I remember a church (a cave supported
By old bicycle parts to keep it up)
Was bound by a broken bell and a box
Containing snapshots and trinkets.

Why mercy?

Having mercy on someone is easier than forgiving them.

That one there?

A man limited by logic, he imprisoned the people whose thinking was infinite.

Mid-sentence is darker so you can’t decipher it.
Look up.

Oyster, shell pink, sky inside. Our prison.

What would you tell the judge?

The difference between a man who shoots others and then himself and one who shoots others and runs away.

You will tell her that decisions are only guesses.
“Resentment is a weak form of suicide.”

That’s why suicide is hard to choose even when you’re dying.
“I wish they would shoot themselves before they shot the others.”

We’ve evolved (arrived) just in time for the obsolete.

The center that runs along the sides of the tarmac
Is a camp without a name.
A holding station.

A glass of narcotics, a warm blanket, steam for suffocation,
For each passenger of any class.

“Did you know a rendition is an interpretation, an
explanation of something not clear?”

“It’s also persecution and surrender,
Translation and the handing over
Of prisoners to countries
Where detention is.”

Will only burn your bed-skins.

Tongues wag and sailors pull their beards.
Some have pictures of naked women, some have boys.

There is a wonderful kidnapped hunted raped and betrayed girl
In fairy tales. She has a name, but the vowels and subjects

You can pass across it any which way you turn.

I had a garden of my own
For twenty-one years.
Seven trees times three
Planted for the first children.

Oh its land was a meadow
And our little house, a grape arbor
And a Wampanoag
Grave in a grove of elms.

Then a tree like an elephant
Bucked in a storm.
And its trunk broke into
A wrinkled little stump.

Roots don’t give up.

And stones only breathe once a year.

Many people passed through.
We could have watered more
Or flowered a path
For the visitors. After all

Love meant life and its shadow.
Children played and grew.
I too grew old for no reason.
Love stood at a distance.

One day the snow will camouflage
The huddling April buds
Before a cherry-picker
Damns all but one, the littlest.

Show failed land deals.

On a slip into the lagoon.

Of time past: ancestors
With our same names.

To A—,"Thinking.
Wondering if
my trot to Paris
to suffer you
wasn’t all wrong.
My amour fou

precise as a shark
collecting scents
miles off,
exact as a saint
cowed before
invisible wings

rustling
abstract sheets?
Your eyes
green, and red
your hair,
iconic in this

television universe
of one man
let nothing on,
no “real” Twitter feed
surrendering candid
portraits of what

you believe,
what you love.
And I sit, subtracted,
before my love.
Wondering.
Subjected

as I was
to plural echoes
nth parts sensual,
nth parts trust,
and to hear there
a call

to illegitimate Paris
where I fit
right in,
Jacques Brel songbook,
ukulele, bread
and wine, simulacral

maudit bohemian
pelted by Polanski-ish
rain, but happy
away from Los Angeles
where you fit in,
being able, in one city,

to drive for hours
and never leave home.
My choked voice grumbled
“de chrysanthèmes ...”
(Brel song) as
I sought the streets

of Apollinaire’s “Zone”
on Google maps
(which I paid dearly
for)
still hearing the
angel

even as
you were angry with me
who nearly destroyed
your apartment’s electricity
plugging in some idiotic
gadget of mine

and leaving it smoking
drunk on uke, bread and wine.
Hard not to think
this symbolic
or a great way to pep
up an episode

of Friends, or an ancient
Merchant Ivory film.
If I were Anne Carson
you’d be translation
and I
an impotent scholar

before the Greek,
drawn by love
to the undecided
omnivorous Word
that paints travelogue,
that shields Earth,

begging
this word side with me
when I touch down in Paris,
that it’s you who’d
ground this polysemous
text

with a kiss, or touch
puppyish, unambiguous.
Oh, that Anne
Carson, such a genius.
She makes
me think.

I’ve never been
so wrong, and in
the wrong place,
a foreigner, foreigned
in my own goddamned
country

by double negation
fitting right
in (as I’ve
said) and you
a Mediterranean accent
amidst the stones

of French abstraction,
pride, often cruelty,
noirs désirs
circling like bats
who’ve read too much Saint-Just
and mistaken it for Sade.

(That sounds quite important.
I’m afraid it’s not.)
It rained. I wrote
a pining song
in a hotel room
refusing your offer

to stay with you
and your boyfriend
(quelle horreur)
who spoke no French
while I
conducted vertiginous conversations

with a curator
at the Musée Gustave Moreau
pinning my hopes
on words like “Gautier” (Théophile)
“Mallarmé” and “Rimbaud”
(who didn’t come up

of course),
and marred the language
even further with the help
of Google translate
in my letters to you
in the guise of, who?

it wasn’t Baudelaire
(I can’t remember who,
maybe Marat,
and you, Charlotte Corday).
I liked the pining song,
in the end,

it’s Morrissey-esque, funny
but grim, slippery
and only incomplete
without (or with) you.
Here I do not
go again,

merely think
flat-footed
on my horizon
(scratching
my itchy head, I
think I have dandruff)

while you
sleep
in a Westwood Airbnb
lyrically, so
I am drawn
shark-angelly

down Hollywood Blvd.
on the 302
to an American-style
aperitivo
with sliders instead
of funicular olives

again with you
talking,
and I gazing deep
into your colors,
reading your Tweets
but never commenting.

The White Room,"So I entered suffering. A room with dazzling walls, starched drapes, a bed with the coverlet turned down just so. Shirred bed skirts. The pillowcase crisp, bearing the marks of the iron. A low wrought iron table with a pitcher and its glass of water. Curtain half cinched.

Was anyone else ever here? Not a trace of a prior occupant. No candy wrapper. No smudge on the high-gloss sheen. Yet I marvel at the labor that must have gone into all those preparations: someone lifting the mattress, twice, as you must, and adding the final touches; smoothing away all traces of a final touch, filling the glass precisely, so the camber of water fits like a seal over the rim.

A radio on the nightstand. It lights up, and there’s the very voice in my mind, arguing with itself, trying to convince itself that it suffers. Why so many hypnotic cadences, so many rhetorical flourishes—anaphora, chiasmus, parataxis—such subtle case logic, Rogerian argument, appeals to so many arbiters: God, reason, justice, twilight?

Search from station to station, and the white noise in between. On fm, am, and shortwave, the same rapt monologue. That marshaling of precedent, scientific data, illustrations from the history of medicine, the Upanishads, the Vedas, the sutras and suras, the Sermon on the Mount. But what is suffering? Is it true that it requires my consent?

Walking on the beach alone, far from the Dead Sea,
I thought I saw a horseshoe crab crawling slowly—

Another time, washed up on a Montauk dune,
I found a Chianti wine bottle
with a letter in it. I read to myself
a child’s handwriting: “Hello,
let’s make friends. Please call,” she gave her phone number.
I held the bottle a week before calling, then asked
for Mary Jane, in my best Portuguese accent,

The Drake Equation,"1. they were a kind of solution

Say one Spaceman, when she lands, will touch
down in a human sentence, speaking Dutch,
a dialect of Mentalese. Her torch-

songs (loosely rendered from the Arcturan): “Baby
Let’s Get Square with Pi,” or, “You’re the Apple
of My Eye,” or “Boola Theta Babel

Bye-Bye.” It might make sense. This is a heady
thought. The traditional verse, viz. “Who’s Your Daddy,”
as sung in The War of the Worlds, and signaled Mayday,

mayday—a little like Beethoven’s 4th in digital
redaction—may underpin what limbic Dutch
must once upon a time have bloomed beneath the sagittal
crest of Homo—

2. exo-statisticians change minds, cite insufficiency of planetary bodies of right type

What, no aliens? Or, with greater dignity,
life elsewhere in the universe? That window’s
shut, we learn. Astronomers, indignant

desert birds, eyes screwed to the long cinder-
scuttles of their telescopes, will voice some doubt,
one hopes! This is too lonely. Heliocentric

humility’s a habit hard to shake. Endowed
with what we’ve called “intelligence,” or “powerful
intelligence,” like-minded creatures, each an end-

point in a home-world’s evolutionary raffle,
well, just must across the vasty deeps of space
and time yearn forth to find each other with awful

big radios. That’s how the Book of Revelations
we knew used to read, rephrased so, pi be praised.

My friend the geometer, when asked if pi
were in the sky or in the skull, replied

pi’s the pontification of a ratio.
Bisected, so, the circle: pi. To show

that in a well-formed sentence, well, that’s human, sure.
All language is. So ever since that fateful shore

of Lake Turkana where tongue forked, where first
flaking syntax split the atom into force

and mass, thing and verb, the copula
has groped to reanneal it: this opulence

is equal to the sum of those simplicities ...
So here’s the mystery: across the placid

surface of the water a salt of stars
once scattered, hissing. Caliban stammered Are

stars. Then, Look, look up at the stars!


4. prose obtrusions concerning the keats equation

Hold it there.

Would you say truth’s a property of sentences, but beauty’s not?

So that mysterious predictive gift of mathematics is precisely that of sentences like I predict the sun will rise tomorrow?—isn’t that the leap that left the chimpanzees behind?—and adding time of sunrise just adds increment to the precision?

So that Platonic realm where Mathematics must exist to be discovered by Ramanujan or Hardy or Arcturans tucked in anywhere in time or space is just that space where earlier equations live, like love’s a rose or tears are rain, which Hardy’s and Ramanujan’s respective ancestors discovered independently?

That if in England two men feed a horse, the horse stays thin, the axiom would hold as well for two Tibetan yaks or fat Jurassic stegosaurs (assuming less that that’s what the Arcturans use to carry mail than that, like us, they pinch their pence)—

That that’s the realm where poems and equations likewise lie unspoken, quietly awaiting their discovery?

And so those famous instances where mathematics efflorescing on some blackboard purely for the play of it turn out to have a shocking congruence with patterns in the world is just exactly like the case where poetry is news before the news it stays?

That hadn’t the acclaimed predictive potency of mathematics best be cast as a reminder of forgotten shock—the shock our shaggy kind must once have felt, framing for the first time well-formed sentences about the world that was, and then about the world about to be, and so extended human sensibility and thrust it forth as backward through the night of time?

Yes, if diffidently.

Study of Two Figures (Pasiphaë/Sado),"One figure is female, the other is male.

Both are contained.

One figure is mythical, the other historical.

To the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, they occupy different millennia, different continents.

But, to the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, both figures are considered Asian—one from Colchis, one from Korea.

To mention the Asianness of the figures creates a “racial marker” in the poem.

This means that the poem can no longer pass as a white poem, that different people can be expected to read the poem, that they can be expected to read the poem in different ways.

To mention the Asianness of the figures is also to mention, by implication, the Asianness of the poet.

Revealing a racial marker in a poem is like revealing a gun in a story or like revealing a nipple in a dance.

After such a revelation, the poem is about race, the story is about the gun, the dance is about the body of the dancer—it is no longer considered a dance at all and is subject to regulation.

Topics that have this gravitational quality of aboutness are known as “hot button” topics, such as race, violence, or sex.

“Hot button” is a marketing term, coined by Walter Kiechel III, in a September 1978 issue of Fortune magazine.

The term evokes laboratory animals and refers to consumer desires that need to be slaked.

The term “hot button” suggests not only the slaking of such desires but also a shock or punishment for having acted on those desires, a deterrent to further actions pursuing such desires, and by extension, a deterrent to desire itself.

Violence and sex are examples of desires and can be satisfied, punished, and deterred.

Race is not usually considered an example of desire.

Both the female and the male figures are able to articulate their desires with an unusual degree of candor and specificity.

Both are responsible for many sexual deaths.

The male figure says, “When anger grips me, I cannot contain myself. Only after I kill something—a person, perhaps an animal, even a chicken—can I calm down.... I am sad that Your Majesty does not love me and terrified when you criticize me. All this turns to anger.” “Your Majesty,” here, refers to the king, his father.

The female figure is never directly quoted, but Pseudo-Apollodorus writes that she casts a spell upon the king her husband so that when he has sex with another woman, he ejaculates wild creatures into the woman’s vagina, thereby killing her. Although the punishment is enacted on the body of the woman, this punishment is meant to deter the king from slaking his desires.

Both figures, royal themselves, are angry at the king, but neither attempts to kill the king—which would be political. Instead they displace this anger onto other unnamed deaths, which are considered sexual but not political.

Both figures have spouses known for strategy, for self-preservation in politically tumultuous times, times of many unnamed deaths.

Both figures are counterfoils to their strategizing spouses, figures of excessive desire, requiring containment.

Both containers are wooden.

Both containers are camouflaged with a soft, yielding substance—one with grass, one with fur.

Both containers are ingenious solutions to seemingly intractable problems.

One problem is political. One problem is sexual.

They are both the same problem.

They have the same solution.

The male figure waits in the container for death to come. He waits for eight days. His son will live. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.

The female figure waits in the container for the generation of a life. We do not know how long she waits. Her son will die, after waiting in his own wooden container. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.

There are many artistic representations of both containers.

The male figure’s container is blockish, unadorned, a household object of standard size and quotidian function. Tourists climb into it and pose for photos, post them online. The cramped position of their bodies generates a combination of horror and glee. This, in turn, creates discomfort, the recognition that horror and glee should not be combined, that such a combination is taboo.

The female figure’s container is customized, lushly contoured. Its contours are excessively articulated to the same degree that her desire is excessively articulated. Artists depict the container in cutaway view, revealing the female figure within, awaiting the wild creature. The abject position of the female figure—on all fours, pressing her genitalia back against the hollow cow’s genitalia—generates a combination of lust and revenge. This, in turn, creates discomfort—the recognition that lust and revenge should not be combined, that wild creatures and female figures should not be combined, that these combinations are taboo.

Hot button topics are taboo because they generate discomfort.

The male figure slakes his violent desires and is punished. The male figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the violent desires of tourists are slaked, while generating discomfort in these tourists.

The female figure slakes her sexual desires and is punished. The female figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the sexual desires of artists are slaked, while generating discomfort in these artists.

The tourist can climb into the rice chest. The tourist can pose for a photo in the rice chest. Then the tourist can climb out of the rice chest and walk away.

The artist can look into the hollow cow. The artist can render the contours of the hollow cow, the contours of the female figure. Then the artist can walk away.

Both containers allow the tourist and artist to touch the hot button, the taboo.

The desire and the discomfort remain contained.

Both containers allow the tourist and the artist to walk away.

The male and female figures remain contained.

Neither container—the rice chest, the hollow cow—appears to have any necessary connection to race.

To mention race where it is not necessary to mention race is taboo.

I have not mentioned the race of the tourist or the artist.

The tourist and the artist are allowed to pass for white.

The tourist and the artist are not contained.

I have already mentioned the race of the poet.

But to the extent that the poet is not contained, the poet is allowed to pass for white.

I have already mentioned the race of the male and female figures.

The male and female figures are contained.

The rice chest and the hollow cow are containers.

The rice chest and the hollow cow are not the only containers in this poem.

Colchis and Korea are containers in this poem.

Asianness is a container in this poem.

Race is a container in this poem.

Each of these containers contains desire and its satisfaction.

Each of these containers contains discomfort and deterrence.

Each of these containers contains a hot button, a taboo.

The tourist and the artist can enter each of these containers.

The tourist and the artist can touch the hot button and walk away.

Each of these containers separates the slaking of desire from the punishment of desire.

Each of these containers is an ingenious solution to a seemingly intractable problem.

They are the same problem.

They have the same solution.

Each of these containers ensures the frictionless transfer of power.

Each of these containers holds a male or female figure.

The name of the male figure can be translated as “Think of me in sadness.”

The name of the female figure can be translated as “I shine for all of you.”",Art and Science
The Unauthorized Autobiography of Jung Thug,"The fools nearly killed me trying to make me one of them:
a loaded word of  bond with dress codes and penal codes,
postured allegiant to the culture as with the flying of flags
from knots tied on the back of  head wraps worn hoods over.

I can’t gunpoint when the life of this alter ego began though
the possibility can’t be dismissed it began at gunpoint in a way,
with an icy pressure against the temple, the mind splitting into two
tracks while a circus of peers clowned.
Going back far too long
now, the camera has blurred my edges in the suggestion of motion
even if  I stood as still as the air does before shit really hits the fan.

I truly went ass-first into fronting indifference, forbade my happy
teeth from public reveal lest they pop the balloon of my perfectly
round face, baby-angled, already read as kind or innocent or soft
from the jump when I wanted respect on my name and women on
my lap like it was said I should. And, shamefully, I did. Several
sistas come to mind here and this doesn’t make me feel good;
a tender touch in the moonlight goes only so far for a shadow.

I had to break it down for myself that being down represented
the fear of having fear.
I still shake when the wind blows,
scary as ever, thespian as always in all ways toward the ghost
of a threat or disrespect passed through me then through me,
through a thin skin then through the skin. So, to compensate—
a mask, what Dunbar’s bars beat home way back when about
standing in the presence of the pale folks, only that idea flipped
upside down, what’d be a forced smile slicing the face open like
some summertime melon instead setting scowl folds into smooth
forehead, brown eyes set at the mouth’s corners, fixing it in the
position of silence like rusty nails.
If carrying nothing else,
I learned to bring this exact look to the danger because being me
to the fullest would be a liability, provide a sharper image for the
hidden cameras to home in on; yes, just that fast—a certified blue,
strolling up to the screen door with a heavy hand for knocking and
his true hand resting so sweetly on his gun. My gun, I should say,
since in this case the cop is also me, like that little angel or devil
used as sitcom trope.

When I Die,"We shelter an angel whom we never cease to offend. We ought to be the guardians of that angel.
—Jean Cocteau
A scherzo of thumbnail butterflies, white ones,
Covers the hillside. God is more
Adorable than music. Nevertheless,
On a given morning, as the wind drops,
Music pries Heaven apart from itself,
Like flowers beneath the wings unfolded on them.

Every breeze is self-registering.
This morning, I walked deeper into the hill,
Free of the sun. Midway up the tallest trees,
One leaf alone would stir while all the leaves
On the very same branch remained stock-still.
Apart from itself, Heaven signaled to me.

William Blake was no romantic. He was,
Beyond the arsons of levity and his toe,
The final bulwark of the baroque.
He was the last to oppose, “almost
Successfully,” rebirth on all the wrong terms.
He saw the leaf alone where no light was.

Infinite variation plays against
A steadfast variety. The butterfly
Knows the difference in its wings, even
As the flower she alights upon darkens
Beneath her weight. The sun goes deeper
Into the hill. Root systems and riot shine.

Did you think for a moment Earth
Was aware of itself? Never. Its adoration
Persists altogether elsewhere from
The very beginning, beginning again
Just at that moment one leaf all alone
Spins into the baroque, a scherzo of one note.

The hillside is covered with little doors,
And the wind rises out of them, returning,
When the music is spent, with all the news
Of the unaware, unreflecting, nearly perfect
Hours blindly about the business of perfection.
Hence the tiny eyes on a butterfly’s wing.

Rebirth is an idiot. Isolated
Each into its own eternity,
Like every pain, birth continues out of mind
Deeper into the hill. Earth riots
With levity. Darkness swims into light.
Flowers begin to imagine the life of flowers.

Heaven signals to me, pouring down shade
Out of the canopy of trees, prying
The sunlight apart from itself. Darkness
And light are the same thing. Music moves
Effortlessly between the two, made of nothing
But wings, wings with eyes, no end in sight.",Art and Science

Recital at the Court of King Carrot III,"Mortality is itself immortal Leo thought, reminded five
years later of the performance. Having come, despite his
Irish darkness, to resemble one of the Carrot clan
himself. Whatever he had read, and the feelings that went

fingers, the singer, the wind that came in and made King
Carrot pop his collar. As even the King’d say now, after

to get from one side of town to the other. And how have
a career without going up some real stone steps? To see
things and write them up, whether on bench or phone

death was always shocking: whether blighted cornfield

defunct toaster or road possum. Anything might’ve had
poison tipped into its ear: think of Carrot III slumping as

singer leaping from her stool, suffocating the flames

After the wind just stops you still hear
the wind’s wild almost, its approach and retreat, and how it kept
circling as-if-trying, as if about-to-be, an almost-speech,
loud and full of syntax casting about for

life, form, limit, fate. To be bodied. To strut. To have
meaning. How easily we wear ourselves
as if it is nothing to have
origin, whirl, outcome, end      and still be.

After the high winds stop you’re forced to hear
the freshness of what’s

shape, figure, progression—widening without be-
coming. Is this the last war now, finally—but no, only more of notion’s

motions—more more the wind says, break grief, loosen possibility, let vague
hopes float, sink—let other debris slip into
their place. Rootless mind. Shallow whirling of  law and more and yet more law
brocading the emptiness. Then suddenly

all stills. It is near noon. No more
spillage. No more gorgeous waste of effort. No more upgathering,
out-tossed reachings of green as if imagining some out there exists—hovering

Where am I from?

In black basilicas
dragged incessantly
down a cross
is a man
who here resembles
a dress
snatched from a hanger,
there: thick clouds of muscles —
an overcast body —
embodied weather
of one hardly-known country.

(A country where I am from?)

Dragging him,
they stick their hands under his armpits.
How cozy their hands are
in such a warm place!

Through a cut in his chest
Eve watches
with her one bloody eye.

Of a cut in the chest — a red eyelash!

But

To a telephone in a long hallway
as if to a well for water.
(Well, where am I from?)

(Neither mama’s

A rotary phone is my gene pool.
My body rings as it runs
to put my head
on the strong shoulder of the receiver.

Blood is talking! Blood connection is weak.
Inside the receiver I hear crackle
as if fire were calling.
Who is this?

It’s me, fire receiver.

But where am I from?

Days of merciless snow behind the kitchen window —
snow got deposited like fat under our skin.

How large we’ve grown on those days!
So much time spent at the kitchen table
trying to decide where to put commas
in sentences about made-up lives,

yet no one bothered to tell us
that words, uttered once,
crowd in the brain like in a hospital lobby.

That time is supposed to heal
only because once
it was seen with a scalpel in its hands.

You’ve made a mistake, you’d say mysteriously,
pointing at lines written by a child. Think

of another word with the same root.
As if words can have roots.

As if words didn’t come from darkness,
cat-in-the-bag words,
as if our human roots were already

known to us.

Here’s Grammar, here’s Orthography,
here’s a paper rag “bread, milk, butter.”
What roots? What morphology? What rules

of subjugation? How is it even possible

to make a mistake? Here’s Physics, Chemistry,
Geometry with its atlas, now,

where are Vaclav’s letters,

1946?

What to do about the etymology of us?
Our etymology?

1946 crowds my hospital lobby.

The face of a rotary phone,
the face of a clock,
the face of a radio on the wall —
these are my
round-faced
progenitors.
But Vaclav’s face —

where?

(Again a man
resembles
a dress snatched from a hanger.)

And where are the letters? One

handwriting?

Inside the receiver — fire.
(How cozy are my ears in such a warm place!)
But where am I from?

A postwar city, barracks —
the joy of a first apartment —
a coat, a jacket, a leather purse
fat with pills, but where are
the where-letters
from the where-face?

Evacuated face,
de-evacuated face,
sick not sick, stuck through face,
vacuum face,
lab rat face.

This country was tested on Vaclav’s face.
Now we can live in peace.

So,
where am I from?

A postwar city, barracks —
the joy
of a deactivated face,
vacated face.

A face snatched from a hanger.
Absence as an inner organ.

In a village known for a large puddle
where all children fall between the two categories

of those who hurt the living things
and those who hurt the nonliving things,

in a village known
for being unknown
(where am I from?),
a graveyard around an old church,
the frightening alphabet
around the village,
an alphabet on gravestones,
marble letters under the moth-eaten snow.

Under the moth-eaten snow

A bone is a key to my motherland.

This rosebush assiduously forks over

thriving as far into the year as Capricorn.
While named after a lover,

it is three-headed, like Cerberus,

Hands can train it, barbarous

… Bee,"I stood in a longhouse
with a woman who may or may not
be Mohawk. Some shift their opinions
about her like meteorologists, as if
her blood were a storm system tracked
in its comings and goings. But the father
of her two sons was, without question, Seneca.
We knew that, in Haudenosaunee country, a father
is to some degree irrelevant, that her own
shifting identity would impact her sons’ lives
like a gene vulnerable to betrayal, causing
certain, terminal conditions. She waited
on an elder she called Steam (warning I was not
to call the elder woman by that name). Steam
(not Steam) would observe the boys, understand
their natures, give them their Creator names defining
their lives during the next ceremony. I confessed
my namelessness, confessed my longhouse- and fluency-
deficient community, and confessed that my clan
mother, three hours away, did not know me well
enough to give me a name, confessed my community followed
a more casual ceremony. You find your name after a social misstep,
a dubious facial feature, a birth defect. Names offer
the name-givers comfort, that your challenge is harder
than theirs, no matter the truth.

Our names are a convoluted toughening of our skins. My name
is not like Steam (no one is forbidden to use it). No one
calls me Batman because of my status, my utility
belt, my impressive batpole, my agility, my muscles,
my profile in spandex, my virtues, but because I wore
the cape to an older age than I should have, and could
continue to wear it now, as that shit is not going away
any time soon. Even kids who only know Christian Bale
or Michael Keaton, lurking in latex and leather hood,
still think Batman is my name.

And this is why I have no memory for when or how you became
the Bumblebee, what it means, beyond the literal.
You soar in gardens, spend days ensuring growth,
and if metaphors are at work here, this one seems true
enough to keep you in amber wings, fuzzy yellow rings,
black lacquer torso, and sensitive antennae.

What metaphor suits the night I left on the Amtrak
for Chicago, past 1:00 a.m., while you stood
on the platform, watching those cars pull out,
the night I wanted to leap from the train, stay?

I cannot invent new names for the ways we slow,
struggle, attempt to maintain the illusion of futures
without measure, defy actuary numbers and because I have
gone closer to the light than you have, the story is
easier to craft and finesse than it should be.

to write these things, to recollect myself.
Around midnight the mountains returned.
The clouds dispersed into semicolons

its boat temporary, invisible.

every day dawn finds herself naked and wonders if she has not in fact lost herself entirely in the night, her clothes, precepts, selfhood. what comes of a preposition, of love, some penetrated interiority. in this new and sudden opening, there is the fragile pink of sky, the lip of wind. dawn is not alone in her discomfort. the sun too is heavy with the previous day’s misfortunes. neither can bear the tentative movement of the other. she would withdraw safely into the darkness but sun is thick limbed, blocking the door. dawn walks backward toward the window, her legs shimmering with light. she will fall — she always does — upward, into the buoyancy of it. there will be witnesses. it does not matter who. for dawn there is only the swarm of light, the heady rush of it. everything else is incidental.

there is a story we tell. a story about suffering. not because we are only suffering, but because that is the story we have been taught to tell. take a beetle for instance. it talks of nothing other than the leaf it chews. the angularity of it. the soft brush underneath. there are many beetles. far more than there are humans. somehow our voices always drown them out. take crows for instance. they have been known to fish. not with their beaks but with fiberglass poles left idle by drunken fishermen. or maybe they are just sleeping. either way the crow speaks only of fish. the cold flesh. the fragile meat. in the story i tell myself there are often buffalo. not because they are prolific, but because they occupy the expanse of my memory, its continent. the buffalo are only a metaphor. snow is also a metaphor. bodies blanketed in white. freezing. we are all rigid with it. the story. tell something different. something about the rain. the sound of it. like walking skyward. away from one’s origins. what has been culled from one atmosphere falling gently into another.

Laughter,"These words of two, three years ago returned.

one day, Coyote sees Duck walking her ducklings,
Coyote asks her how she keeps them in a straight line,
Duck says she sews them together
with white horsetail hair every morning
and tugs on the line gently,
until the horsehair disappears,
that is how she keeps her ducklings in a row

as usual, Coyote leaves smiling, she sees a white horse
grazing in a nearby field,
she plucks a few strands of tail hair
and returns to her burrow

the next morning, one by one
she begins to sew her pups together

when she finishes, she gently tugs on the horsehair
and drags their little bodies along the ground,
Coyote tilts her head in dismay and becomes distraught,
she realizes she has killed her little pups

How I Get Ready,"What song will they play if I don’t come home tonight?
I wished someone would write a song for me, then someone did
but it was a song berating me; it was called “Actually, Ashleigh”

and I think of the cruelty of songwriters as I get ready —
how their music makes their words sound better than they really are
how our feelings make music seem better than it really is

and how the difficulty of getting ready is a pure, bitter difficulty
like calculus. In the back row a once-promising student cries.
What will my face become? Strings of demi-semi quavers.

I partition the day into a wall of smaller
more manageable days, each of which goes black

I am getting unready, I am trying to be made lovely

Pyramid Scheme,"For RWT
the other day i was thinking about the term pyramid scheme, and why they called it pyramid scheme and not triangle scheme
and i asked you what you thought
you thought it added a certain gravitas, and linked the idea of economic prosperity
with some of history’s greatest architectural achievements
unconsciously suggesting a silent wealth of gold and heat
a triangle is two dimensional, and therefore
a less striking mental image than the idea of a third dimension of financial fraud
which is how many dimensions of financial fraud the term pyramid scheme suggests
but i had to pause for a second at the financial fraud part
because it occurred to me i didn’t know what pyramid schemes really were
i knew they had something to do with people getting money from nothing
like
the person at the top of the pyramid scheme, or more accurately
triangle scheme, acquires a number of investors and takes their money
and then pays the first lot of investors with the money from another bunch of investors
and so on and so forth
all the way to the bottom of the triangle
or pyramid face
which is the kind of stupid thing that happens
if you keep your money in a pyramid and not a bank account
although if you ask me banks are the real pyramid schemes after all
or was love the real pyramid scheme? i can’t remember

maybe it’s better to keep your money in a pyramid than a bank
and i should shop around and compare the interest rates on different pyramids
maybe i should open up a savings pyramid
with a whole bunch of trapdoors and malarias
to keep the financial anthropologists
i mean bankers out
my emeralds cooling under the ground like beautiful women’s eyes

i think this was supposed to be a metaphor for something
but i can’t remember where i was going with it
and now it’s been swept away by the winds of
whatever
but knowing me, it was probably love
that great dark blue sex hope that keeps coming true
that cartoon black castle with a single bird flying over it

i don’t know where this poem ends
how far below the sand
but it’s still early evening
and you and I are a little drunk
you answer the phone
you pour me a drink
i know you hate the domestic in poetry but you should have thought of that before you invited me to move in with you
i used to think arguments were the same as honesty
i used to think screaming was the same as passion
i used to think pain was meaningful
i no longer think pain is meaningful
i never learned anything good from being unhappy
i never learned anything good from being happy either
the way i feel about you has nothing to do with learning
it has nothing to do with anything
but i feel it down in the corners of my sarcophagus
i feel it in my sleep
even when i am not thinking about you
you are still pouring through my blood, like fire through an abandoned hospital ward
these coins are getting heavy on my eyes
it has been a great honor and privilege to love you
it has been a great honor and privilege to eat cold pizza on your steps at dawn
love is so stupid: it’s like punching the sun
and having a million gold coins rain down on you
which you don’t even have to pay tax on
because sun money is free money
and i’m pretty sure there are no laws about that
but i would pay tax
because i believe that hospitals and education
and the arts should be publicly funded
even this poem
when i look at you, my eyes are two identical neighborhood houses on fire
when i look at you my eyes bulge out of my skull like a dog in a cartoon
when i am with you
an enormous silence descends upon me
and i feel like i am sinking into the deepest part of my life
we walk down the street, with the grass blowing back and forth

To-day, being my sixty-first birthday, I would ask leave to say a few words to the friends who care for me, and the readers who are anxious about me, touching the above-named illness itself. For a physician’s estimate of it, indeed, I can only refer them to my physicians. But there were some conditions of it which I knew better than they could: namely, first, the precise and sharp distinction between the state of morbid inflammation of brain which gave rise to false visions (whether in sleep, or trance, or waking, in broad daylight, with perfect knowledge of the real things in the room, while yet I saw others that were not there), and the not morbid, however dangerous, states of more or less excited temper, and too much quickened thought, which gradually led up to the illness, accelerating in action during the eight or ten days preceding the actual giving way of the brain.

  Piazza Sta Maria del Pianto, Rome (1840). A pensive study of old clothes sun-sipped dry in the Jews’ quarter, hanging out of a marble architrave smashed & built into a piece of Roman frieze moldering into broken brickwork projected over wooden windows propped on gray entablature. A vestige of yet-legible inscription: nomine fortuna. No important lines, no beauty of object. A pendent hodgepodge of contrasted feeling cheesecaked into picturesque febrility. An episode. A grief in, as it were, parenthesis. A match without a marriage, as after news of an engagement. A church embedded sans façade among the common sort of houses. A succor from St. Peter’s mere bewilderment & worry. Graphite heightened w/ touches of white body color on gray-green paper.


Beresford Chapel, Walworth: a bare, oblong,
low-ceilinged barn, each brick-arched window filled
with small-paned glass requiring iron bars
threaded like halves of cobweb to stay true.
No traceries, no clustered shafts, no vaulting.
No fantasies. No perpendicular flights
of aspiration. Clean lines, and severe.
Pews shut-in with partitions of plain deal
and neatly brass-hatched doors. No pulpit, merely
a stout, four-legged box of well-grained wainscot,
but decorated with a velvet cushion —
crimson, with golden tassels at the corners —
which formed my one resource, for when I tired

  The Palazzo Contarini-Fasan, Venice (1841). Higgledy terraced structures the colors of ice creams & sorbets w/ no bland tinting. No calligraphic decoration. Graphite, watercolor & body color. A thorough spell in the vernacular. Stone filigree spidering rhythmic tessellations w/ some scratching out. Details that become a refuge. Detail that becomes a refuge. A long-drawn replica in which new life may even now be in the offing. A sulky grandeur, by the bye. A naughty jailer. A determined postulant. A barber-pole mooring post. A dipped oar tilting  for trouble. The Doge’s tottering state stepping off on gray paper.


Worn somewhat, and not a little weary,
Sandro’s uncommon Fortitude, in this
his first recorded work. Consider it
a moment, if you please, before you pass
hurriedly on to see The Birth of  Venus
next door, and notice that Sandro began
where you perhaps will end: with weariness.
Would you have guessed that Fortitude allows
(allows? approves of!) reverie? See how
her fingers play in restless idleness
or nervousness about her sword hilt
(sword or mace? I’ve lost my notes about her    ...    ).
She is no match, it may be, for the trials
that are to come, yet see her armor shine
in readiness, her gentle fingers apt
to grip her sword (or mace) should she be called.
Lips pursed and eyes averted, she has smiled,
and not a little ruefully, at her fate
from time to time. She has no smile today.
Her quality must be borne daylong, lifelong.
To flaunt it ever is not to possess
it quite. See Pollaiolo’s Virtues pose
and attitudinize: thus they perform
their various meanings. Fortitude must
contain — must be — all that she stands for. Go,
see whatever the Uffizi has
to tempt you; but remember Fortitude
whose battle did not begin today,
nor yesterday, nor on the Sunday last.
Many a day has passed since it began.
They are so wedded to their righteousness,
those lesser Virtues, quite incapable
of  being tempted. They would not dare risk
complacency. She would be lost without it.
But sword or mace? Go now. It is no matter.
I will not need you until tomorrow morning.

  Ravine at Maglans (1849?). Deeper brown on brown. A limestone precipice stepped with horizontal cleavages to overlook the void. No water but a dream of water years back, far down, running harum-scarum strong enough to turn a mill. A spate become a thread. A visit out of season. A torrent bed of what must have been snow-melt now entirely dry. No stones crumble but flow, subside, rhythmic as cloud, as high-built, as unsubstantial over the long haul. Quartz strips ribboning a treed crevasse fringed w/ curled & unfurled fronds. Leaves shook to palsy by the noon wind’s spite. A rock fissured. A great fault. A graphite rock fissured in brown ink & ink wash heightened w/ flesh-toned body color on white paper.


Last night St. Ursula sent me her dianthus
out of her bedroom window, with her love —
living dianthus, and a single dried
sprig of  her other window flower, vervain    ...
how many flowers are named in Genesis?
Good answer! Not one. Plenty of trees, however.
It was a poet planted flowerbeds
that Eden might be filled with tremulous,
frivolous petals — I dare say he was right,
they were made to be noticed! And to see
a poppy husk fall from a bursting flower
is to know something of the life to come
once the body has turned to dust & ashes,
even as our dying breath aspires
toward our Father’s house    ...    as for the trees,
what can we learn of noble constancy
more than we find in the pure laurel leaf,
so numerable, so sequent and serene?
  open the envelope
petals & may
spill on the table
where I remain
preparing the lesson
  bruise-edged rose petals
cling to my fingers
dust motes dancing
gnats in a sun-shaft
myrrh, or a snuffbox?
  write to me, tell me
who do you dance with
oftenest, often?
gray eyes & red cheeks
useless in heaven
  undowered, garlanded
with no forget-me-nots:
compassed about
with the forgetfulness
of all the world
  honor unwon
kind words unsaid
good deeds undone:
none of these, none
touch me more nearly

Now, if  I say “St. Ursula has sent me
a pot of pinks!” some will say I have gone
heartily, headily mad, but all it means
is that the flowers I received of  late
(from the hand of whatsoever friend or stranger)
helped greatly in my work, and afterward
reproved me in their own way for its failure.
But how much love of mine have others lost
because one poor sick child would not receive
the part of love that yet belongs to her!
Think now, sweet milkmaids of Albion
whose face is your fortune, think of one
lying still there, nearly a skeleton,
and ask yourselves: We have a little sister
and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister
in the day of  her espousals?

  South Side of the Basilica of St. Mark’s, Venice, from the Loggia of the Ducal Palace (c.1851). An eerie vantage. A capricious helter-skelter variety of application, quickening details of watercolor passing  for time-veined marble scaled-up from a daguerreotype. An echo’s volume. Shadows lilt & flourish over chessboard floor tiles. A kind of hectic color. Disallowance of perspective. Sculpted relief without recession. Megrims & mysteries; conceits & divertisements. The uncapped St. Jean d’Acre’s pillar giving on to the southern portico. A Byzantine capital. A sonata on a virginal. Graphite & watercolor heightened w/ white on three jointed pieces of paper.


           Up my spirit leapt, so glad
           to shed this gross flesh and have done!
           My ghost, given up by the grace of God,
           was led where marvels are counted common.
           I climbed to where cliff-top meets cloud —
           vertiginous heights no man has known —
           my soul drawn on toward a wood
           decked with countless jewels & stones.
           It is hard to credit a sight so fine
           as the wash of  light in which they shone:
           woman never wove a gown
           so dearly adorned, so lit with splendor.

           In splendor, cliffs of crystal stood
           crisp as ice, clear & clean.
           At their foot, a forest spread:
           the trees were touched with a red-blue sheen
           and leaves of  burnished silver slid
           quivering to & fro between
           limbs that shimmered like blue jade
           each time a light-gleam touched the scene.
           The gravel underfoot was strewn
           with gems, and the sun seemed quite outshone
           by those precious, oriental stones
           so dearly adorned, so lit with splendor.

           The splendor of the grove was such
           that my grief left me — it lifted clear;
           the fragrance of the fruit so fresh,
           I found I needed no other fare.
           Birds flew together, branch to branch
           like flecks of flame — now here now there;
           no human symphony can match,
           nor voice nor string delight the ear
           with such a song: they blessed the air
           with a sweet accord that swooned & shone
           with harmonies you will never hear
           but there where all is lit with splendor.

           So adorned in splendor was
           that forest where I met my fate,
           a cunning man could not devise
           a fitting way to tell of it.
           Climbing pear trees, apple trees;
           browsing wonders — pretty sport!
           And soon the flowers & fields & hedgerows
           turned beautifully intricate
           with burns & water gardens. Bright
           as burnished gold the fellside shone
           where I trailed a stream that ran with light,
           dearly adorned & lit with splendor.

           But a greater splendor was yet to come:
           a riverbank of  beryl ablaze
           where water swept & swirled in a foam
           of  hurrying murmurs & confused airs.
           The stream bed glinted with a gleam
           like sunlight filtered through stained glass
           or winter starlight, when it may seem
           we’re all alone when the clouds pass.
           Each pebble bright as Hesperus:
           sapphire, emerald — each one shone
           with a light too bright for similes,
           dearly adorned & lit with splendor.

  Study of Gneiss Rock, Glenfinlas (1853–54). A living witness. A verticality more smooth than the water over wch it rears. Glib-channeled water rushing; dry rock dripping — fluid, labial rock, less still than the wildflowers & feathered grasses that cling in unguessed cracks & overhang. Mapped lichens. Lampblack, body color. A cumbrous slab. An unobtrusive majesty. A happenstance long sought before seen, loved long before understood. A lesson of devotion to be found always, found but once. An obstinacy gladdened by the river’s flux, the ice floe’s pluck & laving. Pen & ink over graphite on wove paper w/ some scratching out.


In Santa Croce, here we are
well quit of restoration, for who cares
about this slab with its poor bit of sculpture?
An old man in the deeply-folded cap
worn by the scholars & gentlemen of  Florence

his hands lie folded. At his feet, the legend:

The worn face, still the old man’s perfect portrait —

  Study of a Peacock’s Breast Feather (1873). A single plume, painted of its natural size. One iridescent throb transitioning from the active plume’s obliquity to the decorative’s dualed symmetry.

Moss green moving via jade to emerald, indigo to lapis lazuli: as much as is allowed, having neither hocus-pocus nor heaven to dip a brush in. A heraldic emblem; watch & ward against incipient commodity. A lost key to a blue box for blue girls w/ gray eyes. Watercolor & body color on paper.

the color of breaking day on a deserted sea;

or when it deserts its own, you’ll find
a boot — rust and salt leather
to give back, or dance in;

or should you take the liberty to trespass in the middle of that sea,
re-reckon — men lower nets,
greedy unconscious desecrating a grave;

or you’ll start muttering to remains of springy clams,
their umbones junked rainbows joined by tar,

And made to slide into the vale
I wanted not to drown. I wanted
To make it all right with my dear,
To tell my cat I’ll be away,
To have them all destroyed, the poems
Which were not objects enough on their own
Even entertainment value. I wanted
Through my saltwater breath to leave
A bubble or two in its abstract sphere
On the surface of their delicious minds.

The Doctrine of Photography,"The city where I grew up
was not a western city,
nor an eastern city.
It lay north of Bohemia, south
of Greenland, below sandstone Switzerland
in a river valley, green with fields.
It was the dump in the middle, the rump
of an exquisite gesture in stone —
a suite in Hotel “Old Europe.”

Stuck under layers of wallpaper,
newspapers from a world gone by:
reports of Zeppelin flights,
League of Nations conferences,
“Miscellaneous,” alongside adverts
for brassieres and ironing boards.
But the view to the river
was blocked with gray barracks.
And the southern wing,
and the northern wing,
broken like the Baroque Palace,
furnishings given for junk.
All of it somehow stranded:
the steamers and churches, the domes.
And not much life in the bar.

But then I found it one day
down on the banks, under rusty nails,
heaps of nuts and bolts
from machines long since dismantled,
factories expropriated, torn-down,
I found it amongst the bones,
unearthed by scavenging dogs,
ribs and vertebrae, splinters
of human and beast, so it seemed —
the key to the city.
And found a kind of peace.
And knew where I was,
and where I came from —

until I saw the photographs,
not the ones at home in the album,
but for sale on the street market stall.
Archive pictures, postcards
of street scenes, city views
from between the wars, moments
from a life gone by,
some still with the stamp
“original print, by hand.”

Past the housefronts, all still intact,
over the bridges, the broad terraces,
along the Königsufer, the banks
of the Elbe, people walking, all dead now,
but the youngest in their prams.
Mothers in dark coats and hats
were chained for all time
to this or that man with a briefcase.
On a traffic island, a boy
in lederhosen who would never age,
staring from the poster
for “Riquet Cocoa Chocolate.”
“Alsberg Ladies Wear, Wilsdruffer Straße:
the new bathing costume from Alsberg.”
And the beauty in silk stockings,
getting out of the tram, no. 11,
picked out by chance, and her too,
fixed in that spot forever.
All of them passersby in time —
the girl at the flower stall on Altmarkt,
the one by the striped awnings
on Prager Straße. At the station
the clock forever at half past ten.

A morning that lasts for eternity —
mostly in spring, in summer,
in a city that was not eastern,
nor western. Scarcely a photo
that ever showed it in deep snow.
The sign for Dresdner Neueste Nachrichten
stood by the entrance to the subway.
Soon an r was missing, an n, then an a.
Power cuts, petrol grew scarce,
people took to bikes again after Stalingrad.
Not long now and almost all of it
will be erased, a phantasmagoria
like the desert palace of Kubla Khan.
And your gaze leaped back and forth
looking for the place it all began.
 

Was it the high tide? The moment
that saw the sparkling twenties in.
People peering over the railings
at Brühl’s Terrace, dismayed
at the rising of the Elbe.
Like mourners at a wake
all clothed in black. An entire
people clothed in black, back then.
Though the worst was behind them:
four years of war in Europe, carnage.
All of them losers, people suddenly
with time on their hands, time to
gather in dark clumps. Only a girl
in a sailor suit, laughing and spitting
over the railing into the swollen,
mud-brown river, cold as the grave.

Or maybe the storm in the thirties,
that wrecks the funfair booths
at the Vogelwiese fairground.
Visitors watch the chaos in despair.
Ghost train guests. Roll up and
test your strength, the man in the
straw hat grumbles, with a rakish eye
for the lady in the long white dress.
A storm has caught the swingboats,
toppled circus tents, whirled the
whole magnificent house of cards
into ruins like the glass of a kaleidoscope.

It was always the anxiety,
the thin howl of instability, of fear,
that brokered the everyday
and steered the course of politics —
a force that crept invisibly into
every house and hurried every life along.
Hopes stirred by the dream of
social stability that never came
to pass in the squares and streets
where election posters in garish red
and black promised the moon and the stars.

That, however, every picture is just
a point of view, in which history dissolves
into familiar stories, each one running
its own course, seeming as if it might be
halted for a moment, but in truth irrevocable,
that was the doctrine of photography.
Your gaze leaped back and forth.

Five years later a spectacle of horror
breaks all attendance records: “The German
People’s Show: Fire Exhibit ‘Der roter Hahn.’”

hops over the solemn city roofs.
A new talking point: civil air defense    ...

an army takes up position to extinguish
the conflagration, an armada of blackened vans.
The climax is when, in the dark of night,
a training house is set ablaze.
Fountains of foam and light, hurray!
The destruction of the city street gives
a foretaste of the future.
 

A million Reichsmarks is what it costs

40,000 a single farmer’s house.
Long before the bombs, the firestorm
in which the city will perish, the skies are
lit with signs that advertise fire insurance.
The hoses lie on the asphalt
like fat boa constrictors,
rolled up by exhausted men
who have tamed the inferno.
Dresden, the press proudly declares,
has the most modern fire service in Europe.
And with that Death, the bitter little man
from the old German fairy tales,
rubs his hands with glee.
In “Die Mücke,” a café with dancing,
ladies and gentlemen fox-trot across
the floor, flushed at the show.

And then it all went well again.
Legal protection and rescue services:
the state myths of the moment.
Soon there is child benefit and animal
welfare for our household cats and dogs.
Write that in a letter home to the ones you love
and remember the new tariffs:
“Airmail saves you precious time.”
 

Was that grandmother standing
in the crowd by the entrance hall
at Blüherpark, in a people’s queue
at the edge of the road, behind
the brown-shirted stewards? That tiny woman,
with a handbag clutched to her chest,
could really be her from behind.
(Very soon she will be pregnant, just
a girl eighteen years of age.
And then once more, while her husband,
butcher by trade, is already a soldier
marching his way through Europe.)

Another spring. Imperial gardens on display:
for six months the magic of flowers
seems to ease the effects of the new
constraints, the new laws.
A hymn to existence, a sacred hymn
to the beauty of nature around us,
the newspapers swoon in the
grandiose style of the times.
More powerful than any Olympiad,
closer to a feminine aesthetic sense,
like Hitler’s hands, eunuch-white.

Departure of the concert steamer, the Leipzig:
on the bank at the embarkation point,
swastika flags flutter in the summer breeze.
An ice cream seller has opened his parlor
on the quay and waits for the
regiments of Hitler Youth to pass.
The city is the clearing. What could it know
of the aerial shots that would reveal
its wound, long before the thunderclap
that always comes after lightning? Often
a forest of raised arms stood there.

Then all of a sudden no one knew
what it was that brought the madness,
turned their heads for twelve long years.
Time had moved on. Dumb force
drenched everything in a primal light.
The pavements gleamed and thunderclouds
rolled down across the bridges,
with the clatter of refugees,
handcarts and armored tanks.
 

And then I knew that the cursed history
of this people, from the moment they
had taken on that fatal badge,
could only be recounted from below.
From the cellars, the gray corners
of air-raid shelters, with the sirens
screaming, the children in their
moments of final helplessness.

I was born in Weißer Hirsch —
a wealthy quarter spared by the bombs.
And I exist, like these images exist,
that bear witness to a life gone by,
but say nothing of the dead. Mother
was in safety when the bombers came.
She recalls the blown-out windows,
white curtains streaming from them,
the scorching heat of the winter night.
A neighbor took the children in, sought
refuge in the cellar, that’s what saved them.
When the house was hit, the entrance
reduced to rubble, she took the children,
made for open country, to the meadows
by the Elbe, heading out of town.
That’s when the second wave rolled in
and unleashed the fire storm.

“Here we are in the Lößnitz valley for the cider,”
wrote an unknown correspondent.
The postcard shows a glorious summer’s day.

The Hand-Carved Loon,"And there are
Two birds
In this poem
A loon
Hand-carved
From balsa
And a snakebird
On the tide
Of the river
The oily head
Of a water bird
Cuts surface
And glides
Along by
Tarred wooden
Racks
Ideograms
Oyster farms
Low on the tide
Lower than
The hand-carved
Loon it looks
Hardly buoyant
A bird
From two
Worlds it knows
The murk
On the bottom
And waves
Crinkled by sun
It swims

As a black trevally
Sleek and fast

Handcrafted birds

You — this mucky fire slathered in my mind’s frame
— are as committed to me as artists are to art. At times,
your voice is constant — “kill yourself, kill yourself, kill
yourself” — fists punching clay with the aim to make me
nothing more than punched clay. Other times, you’re
a cinema in my skull, screening me mangled: one leg
auger-mauled, hand vice-crushed, eye pencil-blinded to life
— “end it,” you say, in the scene you loop: this cinema’s walls
with a bullet burst. At parties, you shape a sinister play from
others’ glances: “hate him,” “idiot,” “fool.” When I bloom,
a sun, all alight and rising, you flatten my lift into lines
on a page like Jaffee’s in the back of MAD; you fold it
over and now the rise is the wound from a wing cleaved
and then gilded, the bloom’s a thousand-foot fall, the sun
a drain. Yet with each step the unrelenting chorus of you
circles round me, another chorus surfaces to surround you: the
line of sheltering trees artists grow, loamy and ablaze, against
your gale, the melodies of friends whose works asphyxiate your
symphony, the lessons students teach about tipping your
plinths, the magic of  bringing nib to page and penning life
with urgency and patience, word by word, with abandon
and care. Even though I know it can never silence you, I love
this inky trick because it fills the blank before you can, marks
up your script, swallows you choking in a page-mutating
fold, so your cruel barks, garbled, almost seem to say:

The Orchestral Audition,"I really fucked up. My E-flat key was loose. I only got a few hours of sleep the night before because Robyn and I were on the phone. They gave me the wrong repertoire list. How was I to know that high altitude affects clarinet reeds? I ran out of beta blockers. I forgot to bring a water bottle. I was worried that they’d hire that asshole who they don’t like because he threatened to blackball them at the union meeting. The acoustics were terrible. The second violinist used a new rosin and that threw her off, which unnerved me. My tinnitus roared the whole time. Robyn auditioned right before me. Just as I blew the first note, it dawned on me that Robyn might be sleeping with the conductor. Someone backstage slammed a door and I had to start all over again. The concertmaster doesn’t know a trumpet from a trombone, but since he’s powerful in a certain tiny corner of the music world everyone feels forced to curry favor with him. I forgot to eat. The audition committee talked the whole time. A clang in the heating system was near deafening. My carpal tunnel flared up. My neck twinges flared up. My arthritis flared up. I only got a few hours of sleep. I would have won the last competition, except that the concertmaster’s student was appointed with no audition, so I kept wondering if the same thing would happen again. I forgot I wasn’t playing the flute. I only got a few hours of sleep because Robyn and I were on the phone all night and decided to end our marriage. I really fucked up.",Art and Science
Scene from Medieval War,"When God appears before me he is a burning
woman tied to a bush.

Her nakedness, a missed

spot on a busy canvas, where a male hand
has been practicing female gestures. For instance,

hanging herself like laundry over her own arm.

Nipple-colons introduce this scene of medieval war:

horses crowned with riders are leaving;
horses’ tails, like a clock’s hands, whip
flies of hours off their round thighs.

Time is an insect that leaves
its maggots to hatch on an open wound of a mammal.

There’s more face on these thighs than on all of the women’s bodies.

One, with an arrow aimed at her, hands on her bent
knees as if she wanted to ski into death like a scared

child, mocks the splendid horse tails with hair
so red, all of her blood must have gone into it.

So, it isn’t a bush on fire. It’s red hair she used
as a shield. In the distance, a town burning.

Impatiently, horses whip buzzing ashes. The end.",Art and Science
Subject and Object,"On “Sueño No. 5: Botella del mar,” a photograph by Grete Stern (1950)
The woman sits clutching her knees
inside a short-necked bottle on a beach,
looks up smiling at a mouth above
all imagined itineraries.
We like to think she volunteered
to be lowered into the bottle.
On her own idea, even
her own craftiness, lured into being
enrobed with the thick glass that is the gray-blue
of a ukiyo-e sky of flying cranes
who breathe the steam
of that bluish gray ideation and
end of autumn, or a plume of smoke
from a train in the middle distance.

Swells of warm seawater push wet sand against
spun tips of seashells that sit on the warmed strand
like nobility on a plush settee.
The bottle’s bottom edge lists in the hot
sand, the heat of the morning sunlight penetrates
the bottle walls, and foam and breeze coax
a juddering creature from underneath.
From inside the woman argues with herself that
the horizon is another of the world’s ambitions.

Those ships slipped into bottles
with volition and self-responsibility,
acquiesce so marvelously,
like the glass fitting
so smoothly around her. She is a person
born to be put into this and admired as perfection
from the outside, which is how we love flowers
and dreams, though our desires may suffocate them.",Art and Science
There’s a Limbo Moon Above,"The best-known German goldsmith of the sixteenth century, Wenzel Jamnitzer, is also remembered for his study of the five platonic solids, Perspectives of Regular Bodies, in which he proposed that out of the same five bodies one can go on endlessly making all other bodies.

The five solids originate with Pythagoras, but are named after Plato, who paired four of the five solids with each of the four elements and the fifth with heaven to make up the difference: tetrahedron (fire), octahedron (air), cube (earth), icosahedron (water), and dodecahedron (heaven).

The idea is that the universe is made up of a handful of shapes and out of these shapes other shapes are made.

In a letter to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Nobel Prize Committee, Chubby Checker claimed to have invented the dance that begat all other modern dances.

Speaking of himself in third person he wrote, “Chubby Checker changed everything. He gave movement to a music that never had this movement before. The styles changed. The nightclub scene is forever changed. Checker gave birth to aerobics.”

The song originally called “What a monotonous melody,” written in five minutes on a dare, begat “Limbo Rock” begat “Let’s Limbo Some More” begat “Mary Ann Limbo” begat “Limbo Rock/Do the Limbo Rock,” as “The Twist” begat “Let’s Twist Again” begat “Slow Twistin’” begat “Twist It Up” begat “The Twist (Yo, Twist!).”

Checker calls his dance “dancing apart to the beat,” not dancing separate from the beat, but two people dancing separate from one another.

“Limbo Rock” ends in a whistle.

Limbo, the dance, comes from Trinidad, where it was danced at wakes, but in reverse: the bar began at the lowest height and was raised to symbolize a rising from death into life.

Dante’s limbo is the best circle of Hell, all those unbaptized babies and old philosophers to snuggle up with at night.

“Mary Ann Limbo” starts with a whistle.

All day, all night, Mary Ann
Down by the sea side siftin’ sand
Even little children love Mary Ann
Down by the seaside siftin’ sand

Take a shape.

Repeat it — translate it, reflect it over a line, rotate it around a point — and you’ve got symmetry.

"Winter, Hospital Bed","Memory was the room I entered down a long corridor
Thrown by the white drugs of pain though pain
Was adrift on a glassy stream of green tide
Where images flickered and ran on

I didn’t write poetry for publication
In those days but to grab the attention
Of readers nearby who had been crushed by life
Who floated across the exercise yard like headaches

Smoking rag-cigarettes looking sideways
For the next punishment for a break or maybe distraction
Chips of memory kept rising to the surface
Of our minds to take another bite

I had no idea why poetry the squid caught me
It clung to my brain in the damaging climate
A creature in the alien element of air
Arising from centuries of survival

Thoughts must be inky and capable
Of working the bait with a black beak
For a quick kill and a metaphysical rise up through the abyss
Poetry in those days was a handmade lure

There were no fish or birds so I spun my lines
To the ones with heads spring-loaded with resentment
Their temper a red fleck twitching in an eye

American Dream,"The alcove of your arm

Well, you can have friends. She had never meant

in Korea she asks if anything is wrong. I want to laugh.
Say to you, Isn’t she ridiculous? But
last night a Korean man broke into your room

Cloud Study,"I keep returning to John Constable’s Study of Clouds.
Oil on cardboard,
six by seven and a half inches, it shows purple-gray

thunderheads,
one patch of blue, above low hills and two small trees flanked by shrubs
in the left

foreground. A sketch en plein air, a half hour’s worth of work at most,
it catches
exactly one scrap of sky and shifting sunlight on a blustery

day in 1820.
The year King George the Third died in Windsor Castle, blind
and insane, the year

50,000 Scottish weavers went on strike and printed a proclamation
calling for a new
“provisional government.” Their leaders were caught, hanged, and then

decapitated
for good measure. This cloud study survived that history.
Two minutes later,

the clouds would have taken on a different cast of light and shape
just like the thunderheads
now piling up above the Liffey. I hobble out of the Dublin City Gallery,

take a bus to the river,
sit on a park bench with a ziplock bag of ice on my swollen knee. Its wet cold
makes the joint

ache. My body is breaking down, bone spur under the right kneecap.
At fifty-eight,
I watch young men and women in black sweats run along the River Liffey —

Abha na Life,
Anna Liffey, river that crosses the plains of Life. I envy them.
Once I too could run

over the asphalt, almost without knowing I inhabited a body
whose knees might seize up
and swell. I will not run again in this life. Cirrus and cumulonimbus

scud across the blue
escutcheon of sky. Sun’s blazon through rain rampant, my life is a cloud study
for some larger landscape

John Constable never got around to painting. It hangs in a gilded frame.
People stare at it
before passing on to more important canvases, to Renoir’s

Les Parapluies, women
and men opening shiny black umbrellas in a Paris park.
There a mother shelters

her two daughters under an umbrella meant for one.
The younger daughter
holds a wooden hoop she has been rolling along tamped dirt paths,

whipping it with a stick
to keep it spinning, before the rain settled in. Renoir painted
this small family

in his lush, impressionistic style. Five years later, after visiting
Italy and studying
Piero della Francesca’s frescoes, he came back and finished the painting

in his new “manière aigre”
or harsh style. He handled the gray silk folds of the auburn-haired woman’s dress
on the left as if they were

granite to be sculpted. She carries a market basket filled
to the brim with shadow.
To approach old age, one needs a new, harsher style. Here, by the Liffey,

mothers push screaming
infants in strollers. Five teenagers in blue jeans and bright yellow or green raincoats
walk by, joking, texting

on cell phones, smoking. One girl and her boy hang back, embrace, French-kiss
a long ten seconds.
Another boy shouts over his shoulder, “Get a room!” A pair

of mute swans
preens and swims down the River Liffey, whose amber waters mirror
how the clouds pass,

avalanche of cumulus that hangs forever on the burnished
unrippling surface
of my memory — vast sky surf, cloud after cloud cresting, breaking

to be washed
away to blue nothing. Each of us — lovers, mothers, runners, me — no more
than windblown swansdown.",Art and Science

purchase, finding a toe-hold,
the tiny, spiny, hairy, leg-like

to climb, to shinny up the tree,
the elbow, the sheer escarpment,
pausing to send out a line,
a lasso, a long rope as fine
as the filament of a spider

rappelling, for jumping off
this cliff, taking this dive,
twisting as it untwists, enfolding
as it unfolds, holding on for
dear life as it spins itself into
silk, those indifferent eyes
almost imperceptibly squinting
in sympathy with this closing
up, this cloaking, this cloistering,
this hanging upside down with
a pulse inside. A fluttering
pulse. A pulse like the flutter

of wings. A heartbeat growing
stronger, stronger, breaking
out, breaking free, the wings
opening, the eyes opening as if
all this time they were closed —
the blank eyes opening to the
wings, taking them in, incredulous,
in love with them — and the black

the orphaned knuckle has found
the hands; the hands have found
their wings, and we are all

Chaos,"There are places for chaos on the page,
meaningful, apparent
confusion — temps en temps on the continent
does not mean “time to time” in Kent,
or Greenwich. From stone through weeds and parchment,
through bad times, words made their way to the printed page.
Bibles now not just for those who go to worship by carriage,
but for those who pray with bare feet,
some washed, some smelling of stables and excrement.

I’m not sure the words ocean and sea
mean the same to you and me.
Ninety-five percent universal confusion,
dark matter was born with the legitimacy
of an onion, the roar of a lion.
I sit in the rumble seat of judgment,
I damn myself for entertainment,
for wasting time on hopeless entertainment.
I am guilty of snarling lines, Gordian
knots in my “Shakespeare” fishing reels.
I must untangle this because eels
have hearts like us. The enemy
is symmetry.
In the spring of content,
I trust glorious chaos. I smell in disorder
the outhouse of order.

I must have respect for what I kill and eat,
Jesus gave them loaves and fishes, not meat.
He added, “Waste nothing you eat,”
he did not say, “Waste is chaos made by me,
or my Father, one person who is three.”
Rebecca, at the well,
said, “Drink. Water your camels.”
I swear, my hands each on a Bible,
the only evidence admissible is invisible.
At twenty, I was lost in the snow, a sleigh bell.

Chaos is not a “sometime thing,”
its face and back are turned to and from us,
what I cannot see is beautiful, or an isthmus
that connects almost nothing to almost nothing —
the great unless, either/or.
I grab on to metaphor,
uncertainty, dark matter, gravity specific.
The motto I nail to my door:
The Devil generalizes, angels are specific.
Chaos makes me merry,
string or rose-by-any-other-rose theory,
romance of the rose,
roses that go with any other flower,
from devil’s paintbrush to huckleberry.
From fertile Chaos sprang Eros and Night:
Chaos danced first with Eros, then jealous Night.
Time carries a scythe, women and men sound the hour.

the dreamer is everyone in her dream. Yes,

an oasis city lit by multiple moons

indigenous genies served as surrogates

night birds and camels of the optically
implausible dimensions before our

“I have never needed God”,"I have never needed God
as a personal savior
in my practical life
syllogisms about His existence
were never music to my ears
but always seemed vague
missing a dimension although I didn’t know how to say this.
Neither a philosophical God nor a biblical God
suddenly appears among His creations
amid revelations of wisdom in Jerusalem, His city.
And certainly not in disclosures of pious inner principles
and also not among poets, unfortunately.
Astronomical bodies at night and mystical landscapes in Sharafat for example
and Beit Jala
bear His between-the-lines existence,
His inklings.
The expression of an ultra-Orthodox man’s eyes in Mea She’arim —
this too —
and even the purifying surrender of a sly and seasoned merchant, irreligious now in Geula,
when you reproach him.
Something like “Reprove a wise man and he will love you.”
And you, when you cleanse yourself of anxious constraints about your environment
after taking hash or grass.
Springs of purity whose origins you’re unaware of
bubble in coursing blood, in glands, in milk
and some paradisiacal primeval revelation,
and your almost subconscious innerness
your being suddenly revealed —

Is this clear enough to you, heredity? Genes?
Or existential uniqueness, a maintained infancy that knocks you out with a sense of a refreshing genesis.

Everything becomes clear in a great light.
You shed revulsion and resistance,
a great love germinates within you —
this gloriousness this wonder
comprised of
absolutes of —
objective truth, complete justice, decency
honor internalized
honesty and complex wisdom enhanced down to the last detail.
Ho, complete, divine purity.
Suddenly you polish a syllogism of your own
for decisive proof of His existence:
God is an idea —
ideas don’t have material existence
but they exist nonetheless
so God exists definitively as the spirit of an idea,
the biblical assertion “He has no body and no bodily form”
is clear to me now as an exegesis
that sits well with philosophy.

1

An Ireland, as of chalk, the sky
standing in for the sea, the beach
a reach of blue, the vineyards’
green scooped out in cirque,

in cove, a subtlety of air laps
the eyes, abob like barques
come from afar, and the viator
standing there, poised to dis-

embark, the undercurrent of air
escaping him, tossed to & fro,

gaze wrenched from its angle
of purchase upon the world,
capsized, head now careened
against the suddenness

of rock, eyes whiplashed into new
prospects, he drowns in fire,
enflamed, fine silk aquiver
at the singe of brazier, he

burns: would Hell be as blue,
or the sun the obverse of God?

  2

Now at Laon, the Lugdunum
of the North, deposited on this citadel
of chalk, white arx, former
temple of Lug, the light-

god of the Gauls, & he,
this Celt from Hibernia, setting
foot on this podium, this puy,
this platform afloat

at cloud & wind height,
blown in from the septentrion,

breathes in the quintessence
of rains, alevel the briar’s
pinks, zone where water,
at first cold snap, turns to snow.

Fallen from fire. Autumn’s pure light
whitens the mount, the tufa
reverberating the radiance
of a Cyclades isle, here mis-

placed, high above these plains,
by some error in translation.

  3

At Lindisfarne, let us suppose —
even if Alcuin’s letters to the island’s
monks exhorting them to combat
the Viking may be evidence

to the contrary — that he studied
Greek, that Charles the Bald,
offshoot of the Pippinids,
summoned him here to Laon

to translate Dionysus. Between
the king’s vineyards & the blue sky,

a whisper of the North Sea
in the channel of Île Sainte when
the seals bark at ebb tide,
Johannes the Hibernian cocks an ear

despite finding his coracle of Latin
too frail a craft to explore the peninsulas
of Greek, & carries with him
the long-lapping waves of Scotland

& seaweed’s tang where kingfisher
nests beside nugget of amber.

  4

That which lies out of reach taking
the shape of this white & shadowy
rock on which he is now beached
& whose slope he now climbs, blind

beneath the sun, fallen from the same height
he ascends, would Satan be extending him
his welcome with the same dark
radiance of stone between his eyes

& the same fine peppering of pinks
that spice his senses on either side

of the stairs, against this, what whiteness,
what candor? The sky’s rarified air,
there to calculate the distances between
the things he climbs or descends,

the divisions of the world now
extended, now illuminated between the lines,
the borders of the intangible now flaring up
with darkness, the granular opacities

now brightening, the sun biting into
the margins of the real, the image dying.

  5

Denys, foundation of all cathedrals
to come, mentor of naves, stained glass
rosettes, of all the gossamer shadow
spiderwebbing the light from the East

as it rises, Lord of Ionia, oriental
Ionas, Denys, Dionysos,
your Greek sailing the great hill
of Lugdunum, your darkness raining down

its alphas, its Alphei, the dawn
uncorking the fizz of its dations.

John Scotus comments, his violet ink
relighting, igniting the world according
to Plato, filtering the grit of the flower
through the sieve of the eye,

the bran, the curds of light,
sifting out the clots of theology,
in this shadowy cave, the locals
burning every log in sight, hoc lignum,

a bonfire of stones
held in common, lapis iste.

  6

And if some hick might ask
Quomodo omnia, quae sunt,
lumina sunt? the master
picks up a stone, a rock

from the Laon vineyard, applies
his know-how to the refractory
matter at hand, crumbles it, cake
of honey humming with the blue

of the ambient sky, the clarity,
the tang, the silky feel of the stone

giving rise to the precise & exact
idea whose line cuts against another
idea, steps hewn, crossing over
into each other, pebble giving rise

to temple, tensile, acts of attention
& hierarchy of effects, blueprints
polished to perfection, prayer
welcomed into its breast by the increase

of the volume of silence springing
from ribbed ogives, from angles.

  7

He holds Ireland in his hand
like Carolus Magnus the Apple
of Empire surmounted by the Cross.
To distance oneself from idolatry

means, first & foremost, to gather
together the Earth in godly fashion,
to harden its pit, its core, its blindness
to the sun, its heart of darkness

according to Denys, then to hurl
this handful of earth skywards, so

that it take flight & light like a ball
of sun, cormorant, black oriflamme,
that it crackle chalky winey in the blue
veins of Ouranos, welcomed into

the sack of the crystal vault like a ripe
cherry fallen from its tree in June
among the rungs of the ladder,
if hurled from this great a distance

Earth is no more than a fruit’s seed
in the scrumptious season of God.

  8

In the treading vats of Laon, the light
squirts out from underfoot, the Greek
hill bleeds a wine lighter & clearer
than the juice of Santorini,

the vat tips over, the blue gushes out,
the sheer flood of the world saves it
from being swallowed up, God
has created things as numerous as

his glory, hilaritas! Night overtakes
joy on the hill, the winter of all things

recedes into God, from whom they
so luminously proceed, & we philosophers
who make our way by foot, following
the path of photodosia, we reach

the degrees of the world inasmuch
as we take pleasure in its ascent,
Earth in one hand, knees in Earth,
pilgrimage of humility,

voyage of hilarity to the Mount
of Laon, Mountain of Time.

the hands of writers to guide
him back to the landscape,
once the subject of his photo-

how hard it was to render it
right, and would feel free
of such burdens. A last cloud
on a lake he’d let carry him
into night. Breaking sounds
of autumn he’d leave a pond
to compose, rustling the stream
of images. The panicked flight
of the hunted he’d let the dry
grasses capture, their golden
yield his release. Even in
the crimson cusp of an evening
he’d wedge himself, curling
into a ball without twilight
ever sinking him. The man
swam with the fog and its
very touch of resolve. Further
than any writer his shadows
lapped up the sand. All this
in the ebb and flow of a ninth
decade by the tide, an inlet
mapped by its egress to the sky.
And when moonlight would
come to wash his window,
a heavy tome floating lost
worlds on his lap, often
his other hand would read
the apertures of old cameras,
an author’s intent the subject
of his alignments. But when

delivering its softness to the hard road of the mind,
sixty miles from town.

to take ownership of her in some way or in one very specific way. Indeed there is an unabashed eroticism to the episode, albeit entirely set in the corridor, which saw early accusations of gratuity. The show would grow accustomed to courting controversy in this way, occasionally falling foul of the Bechdel test (a scene cut from episode 12 featured Adah in conversation with herself about the two male leads for half an hour). Halberg remains impenitent. “Adah isn’t just the love interest — that’s exactly what we wanted to send up in this show. She’s supposed to be the rudder, the only one with a handle on the situation who might do something about it. Of course Cain and Father K just spend the whole time drooling and lusting after her: they’re imbeciles.”",Art and Science
From “Anagrams” [iv],"It is generally believed that the writers had to make the most of a low budget and that this led to the grim determination of writing through restriction, bottle episodes, and constraints. In reality the show was generously bankrolled by Thud, but several costly set pieces had been planned which depleted the kitty. Nevertheless, episode 4, comprising solely an intimate kitchen dialogue between Fr. K and Adah, remains a fan favorite. “It was one of the last things we shot,” recalls Halberg. “Kitty [Beaulieu, who plays Adah], had really got into the role by then which was important as we wanted to imply years of previous talk between

Kantian philosophy (the noumenon is a posited thing, object, or event which is known, if it is known at all, without the use of the senses), but it soon emerges that a violent overthrow of the church has taken place, the transept vandalized, Father K (and, we suppose, his ilk) booted out and replaced by patsies during The Hour of Botheration. Its having been titled shows that the recent event has already passed into myth — a further indication that there is no planned resistance. This augurs very ill, and the look on Adah’s face as Father K sobs in her lap really says it all. She realizes that she will have to act as leader, as cheerleader, as mother, as father to the household.",Art and Science
From “Anagrams” [xiii],"But not before several undisputed stone-cold classics. This is why we keep writing about Cain: for all its self-indulgent flaws it just gets it so right sometimes. Every standard element is here: the gang is still drinking far too many cocktails in one sitting, Cain is a hypocrite, Adah exists only to be interpreted by the men, Father K is so borderline incoherent you almost wonder if he’s a malfunctioning robot.

God has thirteen attributes of mercy according to rabbinic commentary on the Torah, and thirteen is also the number of nodes which make up Metatron’s Cube in Kabbalistic account. Metatron is an extraordinarily important angel in the apocryphal Book of the Palaces; it is suggested that Metatron is the only reason the human race was given knowledge of God and the cube forms a kind of “map of creation.” This appears to relate back to the “rhombohedral monolith” of the early episodes, the college’s strange obelisks.

the first thing
Ahmad Jamal played
was a bridge:
he fingered water
falling over a cantilever

transparent.
I try to suspend belief
across a span of hand-
written notes.
At noon, I cross myself
over a painted bridge in Pittsburgh,
sauntering from Station Square

along the Monongahela.
These streets cobble stone

Once, my piano-playing

I gave her a ring

My girl left me,

“Wave” on my iPod.
It’s probably not smart to admit this,

I only saw her hands
say goodbye because of
the beauty in my earbuds.
Then I nosed a wine-

she’d left on the right arm
of a chair.
Be honest, would you
have sniffed it?
What song doesn’t long
for the long fingers of a pianist?
A cantilever here
only holds up meaning.
I smelled
farewell in a coffee shop
as she high-heeled east.
Sunlight buttered
loafing pedestrians,
shadowed crossing things
as I wondered whether
Jamal’s main fault
was living too long
and weathering,
if his main technique
was to cleave themes
or to refrain.
As he plays,
the heart gives out
a rapid repeat.
A piano bench pines to be dusted
with notes, can it buckle
up such wont?
Maybe
there are facets
of bridges
one will always truss,
something phonic
and unforgettable
about how they allow
us to cross.
A wave of daisies
in a vase —
how they ravel
aromatic in the mind.

A Winding Sheet for Summer,"1

I wanted out of the past so I ate the air,
     it took me further into air.
It cut me, an iridescent chord
     of geometric light.
I breathed deep, it lit me up, it was good.
All these years, lightning, rain, the sky,
     its little daisies.
Memento mori and lux.


  2

And you can’t blame me.
This daisy-feeling.
I was a poet with a death-style of my own
     waking.
I occupy the rest of it.
A blue-green leaving feeling.
To no longer belong to a body sometimes
     open to air.
In rain, in early morning rain.


  3

Today was the day of the amphitheater in mind.
The day of a dreaming speech where the light is dope
     and that’s all you can say.
When a feeling degrades and evolves into thought like
     2 a.m. dilated, revealed a star.
It will say this long agony is great being awake.
It is being lovely now.


  4

All the stars are here that belonged to whatever
     was speaking.
I built my life out of what was left of me.
Sky and its procedures.
A romanticism of clouds, trees, pale crenellations,
     and poetry.
A musical joybang.
Touching everything.


  5

When the words come back their fictions remain.
Thunderheads and rain, lexical waters raking gutters,
     carving a world.
The stylus will live in the flash.
A daring light from pewter to whatever.
Now discrete observations produce undramatic sound,
     like I am a bubble,
make me the sea. O, make me the sea.

For a long time the names of things and things unnamed.
For a long time hawks and their chicks, fox and their cubs,

For a long time bunnies and boojum, and a name

I am native to feathers — their netherside.

A wavy diagram in a fusty book.
Foxed old wave.
A soft electro-fuzz enters the head.
A soft fuzzy opiate lightness.
What could be the message in this
     pointillist masquerade.
What use memory.


  8

I came from a different world.
I will die in it.
Someone saw it, I love them for seeing it.
I love seeing it with them.
Love watching it die in me.
It wasn’t behind or beside me.
Finding it wasn’t it.
Being it was everything.
That was the thing I thought as I fell.

I am that thing in morning, whatever motors in the skull,
     something is claimed.
Sudden rain keeps it real.
Rooftops from the window look stunned.
     Cleansed.
Looking out over the day, the pale performing day.
I always consult the air before composing air.

And what have you been given, the blue nothing asks,
     who are you under clanging brass?
Who are you, Saturday; sing to me.

Afternoon shade mirrors an issuelessness.
A perfection of beetle slowly treading summer’s blade.
The leaves broadcast color.
I was born in summer, my conqueror,

And here the marigolds grow down to the banks.
The mayflies drowse above water.
How then the dazzling surface and its dictions

and clouds sitting there by place and sound.
One thing. This thing and sound glitters.
Indicative transitive particular battles the void.
All afternoon a green-gold silent light
     on the spotted grass, sprung.

I know it’s summer even if I can’t decipher the call.
I believe in the birds haunting me. I held on.
I’m full of bluster but also full of vision.
I’m not ready to put the book down.
To stop singing bright spots thrilling the quicksilver
     over my torrent.
I make sounds, forget to die. I call it living,
     this inhuman conch in the ear.
A pewter sensation and wind.

The sun remains a yellow sail tacked to the sky.

Booranga Wire Songs,"For Anthony Lawrence
A large gray jumped, what I can only imagine is a dingo fence last night and made it at least 5 feet off the ground, under a full moon a million miles away, granite rocks and pine trees sealing a Cormac McCarthy evening. Wire song on cold wind musing low, tension wang and resonance, the land and ghosts play along and now and then a sheep bleets, but it hardly makes a bar onto these wire songs ...
  Small spinifex spin
down from a spirit circle;
the writers cottage ...
  (A pact made above the cottage by local artisans … winds rest for the time being ... )
  No ghosting to report on this tour but aplenty haunting of words, sentences prematurely entertained that have the capacity to poltergeist and a writer’s biting off; too much in a spell! To only want that wire song later to floss with, when civilized nights of too much consumer discount become morose, head aching to be left alone and everyone thinks you need to be alone when you only want to sing aloud and be heard in the ides of a full moon over pine trees and granite boulders, simple, wire song ...",Art and Science

Accommodate the action in your life
to wrest the deep perspective of the real
from cubic content realms of atmosphere
at play beyond the bank and shoal of time.

Then resonance begins, and all vibrates.
The syntax of position no more sculpts
this world of interpenetrative forms
than syntaxes of motion render grace.

Yet syntax is the caul on all our births;
and mothers claw the membrane from our eyes
to fret us into life, in losing theirs.
From there, each choice engraves a different choice.

The decades pass. One needle for one groove.
The canticles flare chaos from the spin.
The gyre to crackly zero stays the same.

  She was thinking of the story “Marmosets” she was translating, by Clarice Lispector. A spirit moved out of the shadows and found an unopened tin in the cupboard and threw it at the window, causing the monkeys on the verandah to flee from the glass. You can hear it on the recording at PennSound. A shearer found glass in a sheep’s fleece months later. “Lucky.” “Why lucky?” “Lucky it didn’t take your thumb off.” That was what Bishop heard about it. She wanted something to give to Clarice. Something in wool or a painting. She saw the earth tipping up, as if she was falling over while looking out the window, and she was traveling to Australia via a flying tin of golden syrup, where there were sheep all ready to cushion her, but it wasn’t necessary for she fell into the arms of the Prime Minister. “Tilted space age pastoral,” she thought, but “marmoset” was what she murmured up at him. He could hear his wife crying that their cat was dead. “It was bloody ASIO!” she bawled. Saying sorry, he dropped the unexpected visitor on the lawn and went to his wife’s aid. He spread one of the scones he’d baked earlier and made a fresh pot. “I don’t want any of that ASIO muck,” Pattie grizzled. Robert turned to Elizabeth to see if she could hear, ready to explain how upset his wife was. Elizabeth had found a curious black spread in the cupboard and was helping herself. “That’s not food,” baa’d the sheep detective. Lightning struck where they’d been sitting just minutes before. “Life is not flat, that’s for sure,” Elizabeth thought to herself, remembering the sheep in the window back home, and starting to write a poem. It would be about flying through the air, and strange food, and the floury arms of a patriarch.",Art and Science

Chain Gang,"This song is not a language,
Not a thing to be remembered,
The field-holler tradition of
Teeth and knees
Cursing wind,
A concert hall of   bloody hands
Spilling the earth,
Strangling dirt,
Sledgehammer curses
Of  men busted open.

On Parchman Farm
You could hear it coming
Up through the trees,
The hammering pulpit of
Crooning men and sweat,
The tender meat of palms
Pulped like plums.

Them men gulped down the
Dawn dew air,
Let it catch in their throats,
Broke the sunrise up and
Sang hymns like hexes:

Be my woman gal, I’ll beeee your maaaaaaan    ...

And the killing fields of  Mississippi
Fizzled down to juke joints and
The hothouse music of illegal clubs
With thick women they loved outright and
Played cards with and
Gave bourbon to when their hands
Didn’t hold sorrow like
Pickaxes and the railroad was
Just a railroad,
A way to ride north if  you could
Get your money right.

Redbone gals with rosewater sweat,
When they lifted their knees
Sunflower County was a heaven
They believed in.

Stick to the promise, gal, that you maaaaaade meeeeee    ...

Steady now,
They turned back the clock on
Their hard, hard hands,
Let the memory of fresh linen and
Ladies’ slips like gossamer
Wings, a parade of  plump thighs,
The juju thrust of  furious bones
Spread like grease
Across starched-white sheets,
Midwife them out of ol’ Parchman Farm

And back to the cockfights and gambling,
Back when they had ambition,
Back when they had a sweet woman
To hold, her fat wrists
Soft as butter,
Limp as rain.

When she walk, she reel and rock beeeeeehind
Ain’t that enough to make a convict smiiiiiiiiile.

Mississippi’s where the cock crowed,
A hoodwink if ever there was one,
But see how a man can make a
Steeple outta his hands,

See how he can break away
From his hurt and be God
If  he wants to,
How he can keep his mind
Wrapped in yesterday,
Drown out memory
Like rain drumming
Down like hornets
Yeahhhhhh.

Them Parchman men,
Ants in single file,
Draft dodgers
Digging trenches
Pounding concrete
Laying tracks
Pretending it’s Christmas
So they can keep their hands
Away from the colic of axe handles,
The sputtering earth
Snarling under their feet.
Warden says every man
Gotta pay his way on Parchman Farm
Same as the outside.

Yessuh. They remember what it was like to be a man,
To know that didn’t mean put a gun in your hand
Or go lookin’ for somebody to take down, naw.
They sang ’til the hurt was just an
Experiment in forgetfulness and they
Were back in clean clothes makin’ plans and

Tryin’ to get a little money
To buy tobacco and
A pint with a little left over
To get somethin’ sweet
For the women who were wet
Underneath them, crooning
A tumorless midnight.

The moans of  wild women
Are specific:
A whisper of  hell danced pink
By the rosewater sweat and mewling,
Questions they ask when
Their clothes are off.

When you gon’ take me to the movies?
We goin’ Saturday, baby
When you gon’ get you a steady job?
Workin’ on it everyday, baby
Why you love me anyway, man?
Ain’t a man alive who could help it

The dance, you know, the dance of  being a free man
That never shows its fullness to you ’til
It’s stripped down and gobbled up
By railroad tracks and guards in high towers
With rifles watching your back,
Bend to question mark
Under a sun that won’t mind its business,

When the only part of  your living life left
Is in the things you remember
About a woman who hung
Pantyhose off her porch to
Dry and made you peach cobbler
In the middle of the night
If you asked nice and
Danced with you to songs
Written on the back of a
Watermelon truck by folk who
Knew something about longing,
And those are the songs you give her now
While you bust the earth open.

Cuz your heart is a burial plot
So stony.

Can’t ask nothin’ of a grave.
Everybody knows that.

So you dig and
Pound and
Snatch and
Haul and
Scrape and
Lift and
Tote and
Hammer.

                    Lay it down, man!

her my word “mai,” for “water,”

Field of Moving Colors Layered,"Untitled, 1965, by Alberto Valdés



I’m not easily mesmerized.
But how can you not be drawn in by swirls,
angles and whorls brought together to obey
a field of moving colors layered, muted    ...
others bright that make you linger
there?
Just look at those Carpaccio reds.

Right then my mind
leaps to Cezanne:
his dark-blue vest in Self-Portrait (1879–1880);
the Seven Bathers (ca. 1900) wallowing in blue;
his blue beyond in Château Noir (1904).

Consider now the three, or is it four figures
in Alberto Valdés’s Untitled (ca. 1965).
They are wayward energy, moving right
to left (the right one more sensuous than the rest)
about to dive
into the deep-blue waiting — call it the unknown.
I’d like to be there when they meet that blue abyss
head on.
Will they keep their shape, I wonder,
or break up and rearrange themselves
into a brighter, more memorable pose
...    into a bigger elemental thing?

I’m really asking this:
When they run into the landscape of  blue,
will these figures lose their logic of  luster?
Will they lose their lucid argument of color,
their accumulated wealth of geometry?
Will they still engage the entire me,
hold me,
keep me mesmerized?",Art and Science

Across the throat, the “h” in “she” is tucked behind the folded muscle.
In “she” is tucked the “e” the lips unpurse to say, same as saying “we.”
My lips unpurse to say the names of  God, of    Love, and they are “She.”
The names of   God, of   Love are, too, old explosions coded into granite.
Too, old explosions cooled to stone warm to the touch of  light, as she,
Stone-warmed and glowing, let my lips brush velvet shadows onto hers.
Let my lips brush the story soft, forget that “he” was scrape and struggle.
The story soft forgets that “he” was heavy, wrestled into “we,” and weaving

Wild Is the Wind,"About what’s past, Hold on when you can, I used to say,
And when you can’t, let go, as if memory were one of those
mechanical bulls, easily dismountable, should the ride
turn rough. I lived, in those days, at the forest’s edge —
metaphorically, so it can sometimes seem now, though
the forest was real, as my life beside it was. I spent
much of my time listening to the sounds of random, un-
knowable things dropping or being dropped from, variously,
a middling height or a great one until, by winter, it was
just the snow falling, each time like a new, unnecessary
taxonomy or syntax for how to parse what’s plain, snow

every few or so seasons, and — just once — a runaway child

having promised ... You must keep what you’ve promised
very close to your heart, that way you’ll never forget

a lot of things. They hover — some more unbidden than
others — in that part of the mind where mistakes and torn
wishes echo as in a room that’s been newly cathedraled,
so that the echo surprises, though lately it’s less the echo
itself that can still most surprise me about memory —
it’s more the time it takes, going away: a mouth opening

my life for it, for example; or just a voice, mouthless,
asking Since when does the indifference of the body’s
stance when we’re alone, unwatched, in late light, amount

to cruelty? For the metaphysical poets, the problem
with weeping for what’s been lost is that tears
wash out memory and, by extension, what we’d hoped
to remember. If I refuse, increasingly, to explain, isn’t
explanation, at the end of the day, what the sturdier
truths most resist? It’s been my experience that
tears are useless against all the rest of it that, if I
could, I’d forget. That I keep wanting to stay should

Deepwater,"I have my father’s hair. Not much of a gift,
chick, but can’t say I’m not generous.
     Thick cloud blasting out of my head,
          fat as baleen. The word, his tongue slugs
against the roof of his mouth, is adsorbant,
    and he insists on the prefix in a coda of clicks:
          ad-     ad-     ad’yer see? like a whale, spearing
its noise into the dark. Grows like bone,
    does hair, strengthens against stress, all our
          violences legible in horn, hoof, feather,
the warm ocher of his thumbnail as he turns
    the beak over. I am naked, watching the plug
          braid a borehole, my fragrant grief: tobacco, lanolin,
bacon spit, grease. And he is starting to plait my wet hair,
    passing forward fresh streams to dark slick
          over my shoulders and asking me to guess the weight
of disaster. Absently, I count a kink from flu, a thickening
    for love, golden crown and here, at the root, a length of gray.
          You tell by the color of the waves, he shrugs, walks
to his bookshelf on the landing, holds out a finger, divines
    red, black, hardback, glaucous, yellow spine torn, a gap:
          here, between books, he leaves the kittiwake beak
after dabbing it like a glass pipette at my cheek.
    Abacinate. Abscess. Abyss. Ab ovo. At Macondo, he reads
          people sent sponges, lambs’ wool, soil, books, anything
at all bibulous to save them. In the end, they shaved
     the little girls, bagged their hair to make a gluey boom,
          suck it up, the spoils. He starts to towel me down, tells me
that’s what happens to naughty children, guides my feet
    into my socks and the kittiwake beak, his grim memento,
          watches through nostrils, observes our wincing fractures.
My hair dries, keratin core still recording a damaged archive

From “The Obscure Lives of Poets”,"How is it that you live, and what is it you do?
— William Wordsworth, to the leech-gatherer
Three, no, four, that I know, married women
of means and brains. One grew moss on her tongue, waking from dreams that smelled
of mildew or hoary socks on a smothering train.
One turned to falconry and the construction of seed bombs to be dropped from three-
story houses. One burned her burka upon being released
from prison for the fourth time shamed so down deep in her molested self, washed
henceforth in formal darkness, another burned
her wedding dress in a fire pot while house finches splashed in the birdbath. [how one
moment touches on another moment and a thought flickers on and off ]
One poet, obsessed with vulvae, son of a butcher,
displayed a large bezoar on his coffee table, and slept in the bear nests in the d’Ardèche,
obsessed. One poet, adopted shortly after birth
by a levee builder on the St. Francis, shot himself with a target pistol on a beautiful
afternoon in early June. One lay across the tracks
on the brink of the Tiananmen uprising. One picked up her manuscript, a block of ash,
from the embers of her Oakland home. Bakhtin, as we know,
smoked his very best pages in prison. The poems of Radnóti were found by his widow in
his overcoat, in a mass grave. One scribbled until his last
conscious breath in an apartment in Waltham, brimmed over with hellish fury and
dysfunctional passion. One was imprisoned on a ship
in Valparaiso during the military coup, but lived with his “iron bad health” to carve a
poem 3.5 kilometers long in the Atacama Desert,
and another in the skies over Brooklyn; to cover thousands of pages with anguish and
light. One is fascinated with lichens and other symbionts.
One with fungi and other entheogens. [how the divine is elusive and pelf is conspicuous]
One spent the better part of this life
writing in the dirt with a stick, crossing out with his foot, that his entire tribe could decipher
the mystery inscribed. [Another surrendered
his youth and gladness with lines of despondency and madness.] One broke faith with the word
before the word could break faith with her, and built
a mountain of detergent in her garage. One made a record of night-flying birds on a scroll
longer than the roll of post-Katrina homicides
in Orleans Parish. One does not like white flowers and has never
shown her poems to a single solitary living soul. Another built a pair of metal wings to be
worn once and then pressed between the covers
of a golden book. One joined the Int’l Concatenated Order of the Hoo-Hoo but
absconded for Europe where he lives large
as an unaffiliated psychedelic narcissist. Some just want the big life. Others suffer
into the night at the thought of what
they should have said, un autre esprit d’escalier. One was able to buy his first car
after a settlement from being bit by a pit bull.
One resolved to trim her hair once she began to sit upon it.
One walked alone from Savannah to Santa Monica. The perfect time to read
the Bible and Gravity’s Rainbow. One posed under a tortuosa beech at Arnold
Arboretum when her picture was taken; wrote
longhand crossing the Gulf, got a job statuing in New Orleans. One of the venerated
continues to write though his sight has abandoned
him and his garden is returning to wilderness. One snores and never locks her doors.
One has lamellar ichthyosis and did not shed her collodion
membrane. Rare relief springs from poetry and lying flat, cloud-searching on the grass.
[how a glass ear is fashioned from words]
One poet goes silent as fishes; one stands in a lightning field and slowly begins to move.
[as a fugue composed in an open boat]
One writes again every thousand+ days and plants all things magenta, so named
for the Italian town of that name.
One, as a lock against beggary and death, writes only elegies; was advised by a mild elder:
It is all right to be depressed just as long
as you don’t let it get you down. [how wisteria can bring down a house/likewise cat’s claw]
One dreamed of leaving her colicky son
under the bleachers. One survived multiple tumors in his brain decades after a year-long
tour in Vietnam. Another walked off
the uranium fields, survived melanoma and many more unkind cuts, torn awake.
How here: [The story has a skip in it. Listen, Señor, I have been used
by my own ignorance, self-disgust, my instinct for failure. Pray for me.]

Chinese Silence No. 92,"After “Exile’s Letter” by Ezra Pound
To Tom S. of Missouri, possum friend, clerk at Lloyd’s.
Now I remember that you rang a silent bell
By the foot of the bridge at the River “Thames.”
With dull roots and dried tubers, you wrote poems and laments
And grew more English month on month, bowing to kings and princes.
Americans came drifting in from the sea and from the west border,
And with them, and with me especially
Everything was pig-headed,
And I made hay from poppycock and painted adjectives,
Just so we could start a new fellowship,
And we all escaped our personalities, without expressing them.
And then I was sent off to Rapallo,
               trailed by children,
And you to your desk at Faber-Faber,
Till we had nothing but China and silence in common.
And then, when modernism had come to its worst,
We wrote, and published in Po-Etry,
Through all the one hundred kinds of shy and whispering silence,
Into a poem of a thousand blank pages,
That was the first heave;
And into ten thousand poems full of Chinese reticence.
And with chafing saddle and the bit in his mouth
Out from the East came Confucius and his philosophy,
And there came also the “True-man” Ben-it-o to awe me,
Playing in the death-mask of Jefferson.
In the botched houses of Europe they gave us more foetid music,
Clanging instruments, like the sound of a myriad dying.
My forefather Confucius got me drunk and I danced
               because my savage mind wouldn’t keep still
Without his music playing,
And I, wrapped in silence, woke up with my head on his lap,
And my voice returning to me from every radio,
And before the end of the broadcast we scattered like cards, or bombs,
I had to be off to China, so far across my desktop,
You back to your London-bridge.

And our Roosevelt, who was brave as a rodent,
Was president in Washing Town, and let in the usurious rabble.
And one May he sent the soldiers for me,
               despite the long distance.
And what with broken idols and so on, I won’t say it wasn’t hard going,
Over roads twisted like my brain’s folds.
And I was still going, late in the war,
               with defeat blowing in from the North,
Not guessing how little I knew of the cost,
               and how soon I would be paying it.
And what a reception:
Steel cages, two books set on a packing-crate table,
And I was caught, and had no hope of escaping.
And you would walk out with me to the northeast corner of my cell,
Toward the Alpine peak, with clouds about it as foul as London air,
With you whispering, and with a bang, not a whimper,
With glasses like dinner plates, glowing grass-green in the darkness,
Pleasure-fasting, with women, coming and going without speech,
With the dandruff-flakes falling like snow,
And the hyacinth girls eating lunch in silence,
And the sea, knee-deep, reflecting white eyebrows —
Eyebrows turned white are an awful sight in the sunlight,
Hideously aged —
And the sea-girls singing back at us,
Drowning in seaweed brocade,
And the wind twisting the song, and desiccating it,
Covering our eyes with dust.
               And this is the way the world ends.
               With a bang, not with a whimper.
I went up to the court for prosecution,
Tried standing mute, offered a madman’s song,
And got no conviction,
               and went back to Saint Elizabeths
               Committed.
And once again, later, you stood at the foot of my bed,
And then the visit ended, you went back to Bloomsbury,
And if you ask if I recall that parting:
It is like the hair falling from my hieratic head,
               Confused ... Whirl! Centripetal! Mate!
What is the use of talking, until I end my song,
I end my song in the dark.

Not Overlooking the Kum & Go,"Who needs a scary movie when there’s scary life.
Icy days pile up like empty pill bottles.
One craves hot soup and bear sex. I can’t hibernate
above the Kum & Go when there’s Smokey lights

all night. It isn’t easy making change for a twenty
on a Tuesday night, when they’re filling the tanks
beneath the pumps and the manager’s on break.

All underage kids must come here. And go here?
The world rhymes with itself. Earth is earth
and row is row, whether to pull a set of oars and scull
or a line of cornstalks completing the farmer’s math.

                          Up above the Kum & Go
                          I’m reading Maya Angelou

And there’s a head shop open 24 hrs
they do not sell head but you might think it
the way the patrons come and go all night
all fall all night all fall.

I lived behind a sex club called The Power Exchange.
All words have been charged with electric bodies
ever since I wandered into my first poem.
It was surely the Road Not Taken.
Or maybe The Body Electric ... I’m easily mistaken.

An alder is reptilian in its body, lithe
leaves at night and such vocal things.
It is a sexy tongue the world speaks.
So many licks to get to the polished moon.
Tell me a story then. How did you come to be
trampled or new or high where the warblers land
and recklessly shit where they eat.

The universe I fear to be crashing.
No painkillers for Doug. Ugh.
It’s just autumn come. Electrical storms.
The brave fire of the leaves and everything.

The pawpaw, along with the huckleberry,
the chokecherry, cranberry, Concord grape, and persimmon
is one of the indigenous fruits. I usually only get it here,
and only this time of year. Fear
is real. Especially that most unholy fear
that we will be forgotten. Fruit, when it’s rotten,
opens a door to memory from other lives. Is it wrong
to wish for another life? My hand can barely
write the thought. My eye can barely
see, my soul, translate the fire into autumn’s sweet flush,
persimmons taste like semen, pawpaw tastes like flesh,
large hard seeds like date pits I spit off the balcony
in summer into the parking lot below
where none are sure to be hit nor anything grow.

A spider would not lower himself to touch such
concrete ground. I would not live to see a tree
grow to fruition, and yet each year I’d like to try.
Well, Midwest, here I am. It’s pumpkin time.
The cicadas have stopped singing.
It’s just the crickets now along the river.
But above the Kum & Go, it’s wind and machinery.
Why do they all take the same path, and why
do these undergrads shout against the fall wind.
The rebel angels’ cries are but the check-in
cries of birds, “hey Mike, hey Mike.” It must
be hard to be Mike, your name reduced
in the ears of others to a syllable of grief.
And then it seems that Mike is gone. Relief.",Art and Science
Bitumen,"One might understand Turner, you said, in North Atlantic sky
east-southeast from Newfoundland toward Hibernia.
Cloud darker than cloud cast doubt upon muttering, pacing water, even
backlit by a devouring glare that whitened its edges,
bent the bars. Waters apart from society by choice, their living room
the aftermath of accident or crime. When the storm comes,
we will see into it, there will be no near and no far. In sixty-five-foot seas
for the Ocean Ranger, green turned to black then white as molecules
changed places in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin, the way wood passes into
flame, and communication errors into catastrophic failure
for the Piper Alpha offshore from Aberdeen.

It burned freely. If I don’t come home, is my house in order?
Big fear travels in the Sikorsky. Twelve-hour shifts travel with them,
the deluge system, aqueous foam. Machinery’s one note
hammering the heart, identity compressed with intentions, drenched,
the tired body performs delicately timed, brutal tasks no training
adequately represents and which consume the perceivable world.
In beds on the drilling platform in suspended disbelief,
identified by the unlovely sea’s aggression, no sleep aids,
should a directive come. Underwater welders deeply unconscious.
Survival suits profane in lockers. By dreams of marine flares
and inflatables, buoyant smoke, percolating fret,
one is weakened. Violence enters the imagination.

Clouds previously unrecorded. Unlocked, the gates of light
and technology of capture in bitumen oozing from fractures
in the earth or afloat like other fatty bodies, condensed
by sun and internal salts, harassing snakes with its fumes.
Light-sensitive bitumen of Judea upon which Joseph-Nicéphore Niépce
recorded the view from his bedroom. It looked nice. A new kind
of evidence developed from the camera obscura of experience
and memory, love-object to dote on and ignore. Collectible
photochrome postcards. Storm surge as weather segment,
tornados on YouTube relieve us of our boredom. In the rain, 
drizzle, intermittent showers, unseasonable hurricane threatening
our flight plans, against a sea heaving photogenically,
straining at its chains like a monster in the flashbulbs, on wet stones
astonishingly slick, we take selfies, post them, and can’t undo it.

Meaning takes place in time. By elevated circumstance
of Burtynsky’s drone helicopters, revolutionary lenses
pester Alberta’s tar sands, sulphur ponds’ rhapsodic upturned faces,
photographs that happen in our name and in the name
of composition. Foreground entered at distance, the eye surveils
the McMurray Formation’s freestanding ruin mid-aspect
to an infinity of abstraction. A physical symptom assails
our vocabulary and things acquire a literal feeling from which
one does not recover. Mineral dissolution, complete. Accommodation space, 
low. Confinement, relatively broad, extremely complex stratigraphy, 
reservoirs stacked and composite. An area roughly the size
of England stripped of boreal forest and muskeg, unburdened
by hydraulic rope shovels of its overburden. Humiliated,
blinded, walking in circles. Cycle of soak and dry and residue.

The will creates effects no will can overturn, and that seem,
with the passage of time, necessary, as the past assumes a pattern.
Thought approaches the future and the future,
like a heavy unconventional oil, advances. Hello infrastructure,
Dodge Ram 1500, no one else wants to get killed on Highway 63,
the all-weather road by the Wandering River where earthmovers remain
unmoved by our schedules. White crosses in the ditches,
white crosses in the glove box. The west stands for relocation, the east 
for lost causes. Would you conspire to serve tourists in a fish restaurant
the rest of your life? I thought not. Drinks are on us bushpigs now, 
though this camp is no place for a tradesman. Devon’s Jackfish is five-star, 
an obvious exception. But Mackenzie, Voyageur, Millennium, Borealis —
years ago we would have burned them to the ground. Suncor Firebag 

has Wi-Fi, but will track usage. Guard towers and turnstiles at Wapasu —
we’re guests, after all, not prisoners, right? 
Efficiently squalid, briskly producing raw sewage, black mold,
botulism, fleas, remorse, madness, lethargy, mud, it’s not
a spiritual home, this bleach taste in the waterglass, layered garments, 
fried food, bitter complaint in plywood drop-ceiling bedrooms strung out
on whatever and general offense and why doesn’t anyone smoke
anymore. Dealers and prostitutes cultivate their terms
organically, as demand matures. The Athabasca River’s color isn’t good.
Should we not encourage a healthy dread of the wild places?
Consider the operator crushed by a slab of ice, our electrician mauled 
by a bear at the front lines of project expansion
into the inhumane forest. Fear not, we are worth more than many sparrows.
They pay for insignificance with their lives. It’s the structure.

Jackpine Mine photographs beautifully on the shoulders of the day,
in the minutes before sunset it’s still legal to hunt. One might,
like Caspar David Friedrich’s Wanderer, at a certain remove
from principal events, cut a sensitive figure in the presence
of the sublime. Except you can smell it down here. Corrosive
vapors unexpectedly distributed, caustic particulate infiltrates
your mood. As does the tar sands beetle whose bite scars, from whom
grown men run. Attracted by the same sorrowful chemical compound
emitted by damaged trees on which it feeds, its aural signature
approximates the rasp of causatum rubbing its parts together.
The only other living thing in situ, in the open pit where swims 
the bitumen, extra brilliant, dense, massive, in the Greek asphaltos,
“to make stable,” “to secure.” Pharmacist’s earth that resists decay,
resolves and attenuates, cleanses wounds. Once used to burn
the houses of our enemies, upgraded now to refinery-ready feedstock,
raw crude flowing through channels of production and distribution. 
Combustion is our style. It steers all things from the black grave
of Athabasca-Wabiskaw. Cold Lake. Rail lines of

Lac-Mégantic. The optics are bad. We’re all downstream now.
Action resembles waiting for a decision made
on our behalf, then despair after the fact. Despair which,
like bitumen itself, applied to render darker tones or an emphatic
tenebrism, imparts a velvety lustrous disposition,
but eventually discolors to a black treacle that degrades
any pigment it contacts. Details in sections of Raft of the Medusa
can no longer be discerned. In 1816, the Medusa’s captain,
in a spasm of flamboyant incompetence, ran aground
on the African coast, and fearing the ire of his constituents,
refused to sacrifice the cannons. They turned on each other,
147 low souls herded onto a makeshift raft cut loose from lifeboats
of the wealthy and well-connected. The signs were there,

risk/reward coefficient alive in the wind, the locomotive,
small tragic towns left for work, where the only thing manufactured
is the need for work. Foreshortening and a receding horizon
include the viewer in the scene, should the viewer wish
to be included in the scene. One can’t be sure if the brig, Argus,
is racing to the rescue or departing. It hesitates in the distance,
in its nimbus of fairer weather, the courage and compassion
of a new age onboard. Géricault’s pyramidical composition —
dead and dying in the foreground from which the strong succeed upward
toward an emotional peak —
an influence for Turner’s Disaster at Sea, the vortex structure of
The Slave Ship: all those abandoned, where is thy market now?

It’s difficult to imagine everyone saved, it’s unaffordable. Waves
disproportionate, organized in depth, panic modulating
the speaking voice. The situation so harshly primary and not beautiful
when you don’t go to visit the seaside, but the seaside visits you,
rudely, breaks in through the basement, ascends stairs
to your bedroom, you can’t think of it generally then. The constitution
of things is accustomed to hiding. Rearrangement will not suit us.
Certain low-lying river deltas. Island states, coastal regions —
floodwaters receding in measures like all we haven’t seen the last of
reveal in stagnancies and bloat what’s altered, as avernal exhalations
of mines and flares are altered but don’t disappear. Still,
iceberg season is spectacular this year, worth the trip

in light that dissolves what it illuminates, water climbs
its own red walls, vermilion in the furnaces.",Art and Science

Chinese Silence No. 92,"After “Exile’s Letter” by Ezra Pound
To Tom S. of Missouri, possum friend, clerk at Lloyd’s.
Now I remember that you rang a silent bell
By the foot of the bridge at the River “Thames.”
With dull roots and dried tubers, you wrote poems and laments
And grew more English month on month, bowing to kings and princes.
Americans came drifting in from the sea and from the west border,
And with them, and with me especially
Everything was pig-headed,
And I made hay from poppycock and painted adjectives,
Just so we could start a new fellowship,
And we all escaped our personalities, without expressing them.
And then I was sent off to Rapallo,
               trailed by children,
And you to your desk at Faber-Faber,
Till we had nothing but China and silence in common.
And then, when modernism had come to its worst,
We wrote, and published in Po-Etry,
Through all the one hundred kinds of shy and whispering silence,
Into a poem of a thousand blank pages,
That was the first heave;
And into ten thousand poems full of Chinese reticence.
And with chafing saddle and the bit in his mouth
Out from the East came Confucius and his philosophy,
And there came also the “True-man” Ben-it-o to awe me,
Playing in the death-mask of Jefferson.
In the botched houses of Europe they gave us more foetid music,
Clanging instruments, like the sound of a myriad dying.
My forefather Confucius got me drunk and I danced
               because my savage mind wouldn’t keep still
Without his music playing,
And I, wrapped in silence, woke up with my head on his lap,
And my voice returning to me from every radio,
And before the end of the broadcast we scattered like cards, or bombs,
I had to be off to China, so far across my desktop,
You back to your London-bridge.

And our Roosevelt, who was brave as a rodent,
Was president in Washing Town, and let in the usurious rabble.
And one May he sent the soldiers for me,
               despite the long distance.
And what with broken idols and so on, I won’t say it wasn’t hard going,
Over roads twisted like my brain’s folds.
And I was still going, late in the war,
               with defeat blowing in from the North,
Not guessing how little I knew of the cost,
               and how soon I would be paying it.
And what a reception:
Steel cages, two books set on a packing-crate table,
And I was caught, and had no hope of escaping.
And you would walk out with me to the northeast corner of my cell,
Toward the Alpine peak, with clouds about it as foul as London air,
With you whispering, and with a bang, not a whimper,
With glasses like dinner plates, glowing grass-green in the darkness,
Pleasure-fasting, with women, coming and going without speech,
With the dandruff-flakes falling like snow,
And the hyacinth girls eating lunch in silence,
And the sea, knee-deep, reflecting white eyebrows —
Eyebrows turned white are an awful sight in the sunlight,
Hideously aged —
And the sea-girls singing back at us,
Drowning in seaweed brocade,
And the wind twisting the song, and desiccating it,
Covering our eyes with dust.
               And this is the way the world ends.
               With a bang, not with a whimper.
I went up to the court for prosecution,
Tried standing mute, offered a madman’s song,
And got no conviction,
               and went back to Saint Elizabeths
               Committed.
And once again, later, you stood at the foot of my bed,
And then the visit ended, you went back to Bloomsbury,
And if you ask if I recall that parting:
It is like the hair falling from my hieratic head,
               Confused ... Whirl! Centripetal! Mate!
What is the use of talking, until I end my song,
I end my song in the dark.

Trees covered in white blossom
The remains of my physical self

Darling, I have been telling an awful lot of lies lately
If only I knew what you are doing now?
Standing in the garden and gazing out into the deserted street?
Not a mermaid, but a lovely human being
The whole thing reminds me of the man trying to rescue a birdcage from the burning house

I am not normally a hunter of relics, but ...
It was this childhood scene ...
(My mother ... )
All the while I kept thinking: her face has such a wild look
... as though she had never existed
The fact is I have not yet seen her in daylight
Distance must remain distance
A few proud buildings; your lovely photograph
I find this loss very hard to bear

Michio Ito’s Fox & Hawk,"Ito ran to a window. He danced.
He howled. He cursed the moon,
interned in a camp before he was

Hadn’t he almost died for art
the evenings he ate bread soup?
If he wished to forget those days
& nights dancing in drawing rooms
in London, or translating Fenollosa’s
notes on Noh, he’d have to unbraid
himself from At the Hawk’s Well,
& then let go of the Egyptian
mask Dulac painted him into —
claws, beak, feathers, & legend.
Why did that silly boy tell a story
about his grandmother weeping
when she first saw him dressed
in his grandfather’s samurai armor
to hold the gaze of Lady Cunard?
He was again studying the fox
holding a biscuit in his hand,
saying, “I went to a great hill
in Hampstead & I made my soul
into the soul of a fox.” Finally,
he would let go of his Europe,
& not think of those he loved
& taught, Isadora lost. Now,
powerless & alone, he dances
his ten steps again & again,
wanting to know if a hawk
could peck the eyes out of a fox.",Nature

beneath the pumps and the manager’s on break.

All underage kids must come here. And go here?
The world rhymes with itself. Earth is earth

It is a sexy tongue the world speaks.

The pawpaw, along with the huckleberry,
the chokecherry, cranberry, Concord grape, and persimmon
is one of the indigenous fruits. I usually only get it here,
and only this time of year. Fear
is real. Especially that most unholy fear
that we will be forgotten. Fruit, when it’s rotten,
opens a door to memory from other lives. Is it wrong
to wish for another life? My hand can barely
write the thought. My eye can barely
see, my soul, translate the fire into autumn’s sweet flush,
persimmons taste like semen, pawpaw tastes like flesh,
large hard seeds like date pits I spit off the balcony
in summer into the parking lot below
where none are sure to be hit nor anything grow.

Cloud darker than cloud cast doubt upon muttering, pacing water, even
backlit by a devouring glare that whitened its edges,

the aftermath of accident or crime. When the storm comes,
we will see into it, there will be no near and no far. In sixty-five-foot seas
for the Ocean Ranger, green turned to black then white as molecules
changed places in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin, the way wood passes into
flame, and communication errors into catastrophic failure

It burned freely. If I don’t come home, is my house in order?
Big fear travels in the Sikorsky. Twelve-hour shifts travel with them,
the deluge system, aqueous foam. Machinery’s one note
hammering the heart, identity compressed with intentions, drenched,
the tired body performs delicately timed, brutal tasks no training
adequately represents and which consume the perceivable world.
In beds on the drilling platform in suspended disbelief,
identified by the unlovely sea’s aggression, no sleep aids,
should a directive come. Underwater welders deeply unconscious.
Survival suits profane in lockers. By dreams of marine flares
and inflatables, buoyant smoke, percolating fret,
one is weakened. Violence enters the imagination.

Clouds previously unrecorded. Unlocked, the gates of light

Light-sensitive bitumen of Judea upon which Joseph-Nicéphore Niépce
recorded the view from his bedroom. It looked nice. A new kind
of evidence developed from the camera obscura of experience

photochrome postcards. Storm surge as weather segment,
tornados on YouTube relieve us of our boredom. In the rain, 
drizzle, intermittent showers, unseasonable hurricane threatening
our flight plans, against a sea heaving photogenically,
straining at its chains like a monster in the flashbulbs, on wet stones
astonishingly slick, we take selfies, post them, and can’t undo it.

Meaning takes place in time. By elevated circumstance
of Burtynsky’s drone helicopters, revolutionary lenses
pester Alberta’s tar sands, sulphur ponds’ rhapsodic upturned faces,
photographs that happen in our name and in the name

the McMurray Formation’s freestanding ruin mid-aspect
to an infinity of abstraction. A physical symptom assails
our vocabulary and things acquire a literal feeling from which
one does not recover. Mineral dissolution, complete. Accommodation space, 
low. Confinement, relatively broad, extremely complex stratigraphy, 
reservoirs stacked and composite. An area roughly the size
of England stripped of boreal forest and muskeg, unburdened
by hydraulic rope shovels of its overburden. Humiliated,
blinded, walking in circles. Cycle of soak and dry and residue.

The will creates effects no will can overturn, and that seem,
with the passage of time, necessary, as the past assumes a pattern.
Thought approaches the future and the future,
like a heavy unconventional oil, advances. Hello infrastructure,
Dodge Ram 1500, no one else wants to get killed on Highway 63,
the all-weather road by the Wandering River where earthmovers remain
unmoved by our schedules. White crosses in the ditches,
white crosses in the glove box. The west stands for relocation, the east 
for lost causes. Would you conspire to serve tourists in a fish restaurant
the rest of your life? I thought not. Drinks are on us bushpigs now, 
though this camp is no place for a tradesman. Devon’s Jackfish is five-star, 
an obvious exception. But Mackenzie, Voyageur, Millennium, Borealis —
years ago we would have burned them to the ground. Suncor Firebag 

has Wi-Fi, but will track usage. Guard towers and turnstiles at Wapasu —
we’re guests, after all, not prisoners, right? 
Efficiently squalid, briskly producing raw sewage, black mold,
botulism, fleas, remorse, madness, lethargy, mud, it’s not
a spiritual home, this bleach taste in the waterglass, layered garments, 
fried food, bitter complaint in plywood drop-ceiling bedrooms strung out
on whatever and general offense and why doesn’t anyone smoke
anymore. Dealers and prostitutes cultivate their terms
organically, as demand matures. The Athabasca River’s color isn’t good.
Should we not encourage a healthy dread of the wild places?
Consider the operator crushed by a slab of ice, our electrician mauled 
by a bear at the front lines of project expansion
into the inhumane forest. Fear not, we are worth more than many sparrows.
They pay for insignificance with their lives. It’s the structure.

Jackpine Mine photographs beautifully on the shoulders of the day,
in the minutes before sunset it’s still legal to hunt. One might,
like Caspar David Friedrich’s Wanderer, at a certain remove
from principal events, cut a sensitive figure in the presence
of the sublime. Except you can smell it down here. Corrosive
vapors unexpectedly distributed, caustic particulate infiltrates
your mood. As does the tar sands beetle whose bite scars, from whom
grown men run. Attracted by the same sorrowful chemical compound
emitted by damaged trees on which it feeds, its aural signature
approximates the rasp of causatum rubbing its parts together.
The only other living thing in situ, in the open pit where swims 
the bitumen, extra brilliant, dense, massive, in the Greek asphaltos,
“to make stable,” “to secure.” Pharmacist’s earth that resists decay,
resolves and attenuates, cleanses wounds. Once used to burn
the houses of our enemies, upgraded now to refinery-ready feedstock,
raw crude flowing through channels of production and distribution. 
Combustion is our style. It steers all things from the black grave
of Athabasca-Wabiskaw. Cold Lake. Rail lines of

Lac-Mégantic. The optics are bad. We’re all downstream now.
Action resembles waiting for a decision made
on our behalf, then despair after the fact. Despair which,
like bitumen itself, applied to render darker tones or an emphatic
tenebrism, imparts a velvety lustrous disposition,
but eventually discolors to a black treacle that degrades
any pigment it contacts. Details in sections of Raft of the Medusa
can no longer be discerned. In 1816, the Medusa’s captain,
in a spasm of flamboyant incompetence, ran aground
on the African coast, and fearing the ire of his constituents,
refused to sacrifice the cannons. They turned on each other,
147 low souls herded onto a makeshift raft cut loose from lifeboats
of the wealthy and well-connected. The signs were there,

risk/reward coefficient alive in the wind, the locomotive,
small tragic towns left for work, where the only thing manufactured
is the need for work. Foreshortening and a receding horizon
include the viewer in the scene, should the viewer wish
to be included in the scene. One can’t be sure if the brig, Argus,
is racing to the rescue or departing. It hesitates in the distance,
in its nimbus of fairer weather, the courage and compassion
of a new age onboard. Géricault’s pyramidical composition —
dead and dying in the foreground from which the strong succeed upward
toward an emotional peak —
an influence for Turner’s Disaster at Sea, the vortex structure of
The Slave Ship: all those abandoned, where is thy market now?

It’s difficult to imagine everyone saved, it’s unaffordable. Waves
disproportionate, organized in depth, panic modulating
the speaking voice. The situation so harshly primary and not beautiful
when you don’t go to visit the seaside, but the seaside visits you,
rudely, breaks in through the basement, ascends stairs
to your bedroom, you can’t think of it generally then. The constitution
of things is accustomed to hiding. Rearrangement will not suit us.
Certain low-lying river deltas. Island states, coastal regions —
floodwaters receding in measures like all we haven’t seen the last of
reveal in stagnancies and bloat what’s altered, as avernal exhalations
of mines and flares are altered but don’t disappear. Still,
iceberg season is spectacular this year, worth the trip
to photograph in evening ourselves before the abundance when, aflame
in light that dissolves what it illuminates, water climbs
its own red walls, vermilion in the furnaces.",Nature

"Fourth of July, 2012","I remember a performance
of Antigone in which she
threw herself on the floor of
the universe and picked up
a piece of dust. Is that
the particle? It startled me.
Was it Scripted? Directed?
Driven? I am a girl, Antigone.
I have a sister. We love
each other terribly. I am a woman
of property. The milk of the footlights.
The folds of the curtain. I remember
a performance of Antigone. She stooped.
There was a wild particle.
It was glorified by my distance.
I heard the hooves of the dust.
The ticking of the script
calibrating oblivion. I saw
the particle hanging
and Antigone needed something
to do with her hands
and she did it.",Nature

How to Draw a Perfect Circle,"I can imitate the spheres of the model’s body, her head,
Her mouth, the chin she rests at the bend of her elbow
But nothing tells me how to make the pupils spiral

From her gaze. Everything the eye sees enters a circle,
The world is connected to a circle: breath spools from the nostrils
And any love to be open becomes an O. The shape inside the circle

Is a circle, the egg fallen outside the nest the serpent circles
Rests in the serpent’s gaze the way my gaze rests on the model.
In a blind contour drawing the eye tracks the subject

Without observing what the hand is doing. Everything is connected
By a line curling and canceling itself like the shape of a snake
Swallowing its own decadent tail or a mind that means to destroy itself,

A man circling a railway underpass before attacking a policeman.
To draw the model’s nipples I have to let myself be carried away.
I love all the parts of the body. There are as many curves

As there are jewels of matrimony, as many whirls as there are teeth
In the mouth of the future: the mute pearls a bride wears to her wedding,
The sleeping ovaries like the heads of riders bunched in a tunnel.

The doors of the subway car imitate an O opening and closing,
In the blood the O spirals its helix of defects, genetic shadows,
But there are no instructions for identifying loved ones who go crazy.

When one morning a black man stabs a black transit cop in the face
And the cop, bleeding from his eye, kills the assailant, no one traveling
To the subway sees it quickly enough to make a camera phone witness.

The scene must be carried on the tongue, it must be carried
On the news into the future where it will distract the eyes working
Lines into paper. This is what blind contour drawing conjures in me.

At the center of God looms an O, the devil believes justice is shaped
Like a zero, a militant helmet or war drum, a fist or gun barrel,
A barrel of ruined eggs or skulls. To lift anything from a field

The lifter bends like a broken O. The weight of the body
Lowered into a hole can make anyone say Oh: the onlookers,
The mother, the brothers and sisters. Omen begins with an O.

When I looked into my past I saw the boy I had not seen in years
Do a standing backflip so daring the onlookers called him crazy.
I did not see a moon as white as an onion but I saw a paper plate

Upon which the boy held a plastic knife and sopping meat.
An assailant is a man with history. His mother struggles
To cut an onion preparing a meal to be served after the funeral.

The onion is the best symbol of the O. Sliced, a volatile gas stings
The slicer’s eyes like a punishment clouding them until they see
What someone trapped beneath a lid of water sees:

A soft-edged world, a blur of blooms holding a coffin afloat.
The onion is pungent, its scent infects the air with sadness,
All the pallbearers smell it. The mourners watch each other,

They watch the pastor’s ambivalence, they wait for the doors to open,
They wait for the appearance of the wounded one-eyed victim
And his advocates, strangers who do not consider the assailant’s funeral

Appeasement. Before that day the officer had never fired his gun
In the line of duty. He was chatting with a cabdriver
Beneath the tracks when my cousin circled him holding a knife.

The wound caused no brain damage though his eyeball was severed.
I am not sure how a man with no eye weeps. In the Odyssey
Pink water descends the Cyclops’s cratered face after Odysseus

Drives a burning log into it. Anyone could do it. Anyone could
Begin the day with his eyes and end it blind or deceased,
Anyone could lose his mind or his vision. When I go crazy

I am afraid I will walk the streets naked, I am afraid I will shout
Every fucked up thing that troubles or enchants me, I will try to murder
Or make love to everybody before the police handcuff or murder me.

Though the bullet exits a perfect hole it does not leave perfect holes
In the body. A wound is a cell and portal. Without it the blood runs
With no outlet. It is possible to draw handcuffs using loops

Shaped like the symbol for infinity, from the Latin infinitas
Meaning unboundedness. The way you get to anything
Is context. In a blind contour it is not possible to give your subject

A disconnected gaze. Separated from the hand the artist’s eye
Begins its own journey. It could have been the same for the Cyclops,
A giant whose gouged eye socket was so large a whole onion

Could fit into it. Separated from the body the eye begins
Its own journey. The world comes full circle: the hours, the harvests,
When the part of the body that holds the soul is finally decomposed

It becomes a circle, a hole that holds everything: blemish, cell,
Womb, parts of the body no one can see. I watched the model
Pull a button loose on her jeans and step out of them

As one might out of a hole in a blue valley, a sea. I found myself
In the dark, I found myself entering her body like a delicate shell
Or soft pill, like this curved thumb of mine against her lips.

You must look without looking to make the perfect circle.
The line, the mind must be a blind continuous liquid
Until the drawing is complete.",Nature
[Persian Letters],"Dear Aleph,

Like Ovid: I’ll have no last words.
This is what it means to die among barbarians. Bar bar bar

The Poet,"As P strolled the path around the pond, he sniffed the humid air. His kimono brushed the parched ground. The metals of the earth rose up in traces of dust and hints of lightning: a waft of petrichor, the smell before the rain.

Beyond the pale hills of his peaceful land, scores of horse soldiers prepared their armor. Soon the soldiers would sweep across the plains, and the dry politics of princely maneuverings would be as rice paper soaked with blood. Instead of petty policies — immensity. Peaceful farmers would be impaled, paltry officials imprisoned — twisted, screaming, then praying. There on the dusty path the young poet P was just perceiving the beforeness of it all, the pre-.

From his masters he had learned that immensity makes the small crucial. A little poem before a big war becomes a necessity.

And like a small poem on a long scroll, a lily pad appeared on the pond. P stopped to peer. He puzzled through its pattern of green inside green on water.

A poem began to perfuse. It was inside P, but it was also on the lily pad.

At    ...    On    ...    At first only prepositions came to him.

He stared into the water, seeing the silvery clouds reflected. Then he leaned at an extreme angle and noticed the pattern of his gown wavering in the reeds. A pinpoint of a poem stabbed him, like the sharp scent of earth before the rain. Petrichor: before, before.

•

Then drops pelted the pond, pipped at the pond, plunged toward it, plummeted into it, driving P to take refuge beneath the deep tiled eaves of his house.

Inside the sliding paper doors were a desk and a futon. On the desk lay a brush. On the futon lay a lover in uneasy sleep on petal-printed silk.

He chose the desk. He lifted the brush while looking down at the restive slumberer. In a mere matter of stopped time he had his poem, written from the very tissues of an arm and hand that could plunge a sword.
Silver soldiers mass
on far horizons, but here,
silk pools on the bed.
The rain rained; moisture curled the edges of the paper. Seventeen syllables, an epic of energy, made him drowsy and hungry. His lover still asleep, he rose, ate leftover peaches poached in soy sauce and ginger, and, with the rain a drizzle, thought again of his poem. How could he have loved it in the instant after he wrote it, but now be so unsure?

He sat at his desk again. Another one? This time he drafted:
Poppy? Penis up.
Prow into periwinkle.
Peony behind.
After he calligraphed the puzzle of passion across the page, he woke the one in the pond of pink silk, and they proved it on the futon. He heard the pluvial patter on the eaves, while they angled and slipped, perspiring on silk. The stamping and snorting of the horses sweating in their armor was far too far away to be sensed by P, but he heard. He felt the pond muddied and the roof cracked and the poems scattered. How far was he now from this picture in his mind? He worked to make his pleasure stay, pitiable and small against the portents rising, for P was afraid this afternoon would never be remembered after the bloody conquering.

But later the barbarians would bivouac in this house, the pond saved for drinking water, the path roughened by horses, and the reverse of P’s scroll used for another man’s military diary, his afternoon’s foreboding and pleasure a preparation for the future, and in the future, a stay against another’s view of the past.

Chinese Silence No. 92,"After “Exile’s Letter” by Ezra Pound
To Tom S. of Missouri, possum friend, clerk at Lloyd’s.
Now I remember that you rang a silent bell
By the foot of the bridge at the River “Thames.”
With dull roots and dried tubers, you wrote poems and laments
And grew more English month on month, bowing to kings and princes.
Americans came drifting in from the sea and from the west border,
And with them, and with me especially
Everything was pig-headed,
And I made hay from poppycock and painted adjectives,
Just so we could start a new fellowship,
And we all escaped our personalities, without expressing them.
And then I was sent off to Rapallo,
               trailed by children,
And you to your desk at Faber-Faber,
Till we had nothing but China and silence in common.
And then, when modernism had come to its worst,
We wrote, and published in Po-Etry,
Through all the one hundred kinds of shy and whispering silence,
Into a poem of a thousand blank pages,
That was the first heave;
And into ten thousand poems full of Chinese reticence.
And with chafing saddle and the bit in his mouth
Out from the East came Confucius and his philosophy,
And there came also the “True-man” Ben-it-o to awe me,
Playing in the death-mask of Jefferson.
In the botched houses of Europe they gave us more foetid music,
Clanging instruments, like the sound of a myriad dying.
My forefather Confucius got me drunk and I danced
               because my savage mind wouldn’t keep still
Without his music playing,
And I, wrapped in silence, woke up with my head on his lap,
And my voice returning to me from every radio,
And before the end of the broadcast we scattered like cards, or bombs,
I had to be off to China, so far across my desktop,
You back to your London-bridge.

And our Roosevelt, who was brave as a rodent,
Was president in Washing Town, and let in the usurious rabble.
And one May he sent the soldiers for me,
               despite the long distance.
And what with broken idols and so on, I won’t say it wasn’t hard going,
Over roads twisted like my brain’s folds.
And I was still going, late in the war,
               with defeat blowing in from the North,
Not guessing how little I knew of the cost,
               and how soon I would be paying it.
And what a reception:
Steel cages, two books set on a packing-crate table,
And I was caught, and had no hope of escaping.
And you would walk out with me to the northeast corner of my cell,
Toward the Alpine peak, with clouds about it as foul as London air,
With you whispering, and with a bang, not a whimper,
With glasses like dinner plates, glowing grass-green in the darkness,
Pleasure-fasting, with women, coming and going without speech,
With the dandruff-flakes falling like snow,
And the hyacinth girls eating lunch in silence,
And the sea, knee-deep, reflecting white eyebrows —
Eyebrows turned white are an awful sight in the sunlight,
Hideously aged —
And the sea-girls singing back at us,
Drowning in seaweed brocade,
And the wind twisting the song, and desiccating it,
Covering our eyes with dust.
               And this is the way the world ends.
               With a bang, not with a whimper.
I went up to the court for prosecution,
Tried standing mute, offered a madman’s song,
And got no conviction,
               and went back to Saint Elizabeths
               Committed.
And once again, later, you stood at the foot of my bed,
And then the visit ended, you went back to Bloomsbury,
And if you ask if I recall that parting:
It is like the hair falling from my hieratic head,
               Confused ... Whirl! Centripetal! Mate!
What is the use of talking, until I end my song,
I end my song in the dark.
I call in the nurse,
Hold the pill in my hand

And swallow it down, silent.",Mythology and Folklore

opens a door to memory from other lives. Is it wrong

Bitumen,"One might understand Turner, you said, in North Atlantic sky
east-southeast from Newfoundland toward Hibernia.
Cloud darker than cloud cast doubt upon muttering, pacing water, even
backlit by a devouring glare that whitened its edges,
bent the bars. Waters apart from society by choice, their living room
the aftermath of accident or crime. When the storm comes,
we will see into it, there will be no near and no far. In sixty-five-foot seas
for the Ocean Ranger, green turned to black then white as molecules
changed places in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin, the way wood passes into
flame, and communication errors into catastrophic failure
for the Piper Alpha offshore from Aberdeen.

It burned freely. If I don’t come home, is my house in order?
Big fear travels in the Sikorsky. Twelve-hour shifts travel with them,
the deluge system, aqueous foam. Machinery’s one note
hammering the heart, identity compressed with intentions, drenched,
the tired body performs delicately timed, brutal tasks no training
adequately represents and which consume the perceivable world.
In beds on the drilling platform in suspended disbelief,
identified by the unlovely sea’s aggression, no sleep aids,
should a directive come. Underwater welders deeply unconscious.
Survival suits profane in lockers. By dreams of marine flares
and inflatables, buoyant smoke, percolating fret,
one is weakened. Violence enters the imagination.

Clouds previously unrecorded. Unlocked, the gates of light
and technology of capture in bitumen oozing from fractures
in the earth or afloat like other fatty bodies, condensed
by sun and internal salts, harassing snakes with its fumes.
Light-sensitive bitumen of Judea upon which Joseph-Nicéphore Niépce
recorded the view from his bedroom. It looked nice. A new kind
of evidence developed from the camera obscura of experience
and memory, love-object to dote on and ignore. Collectible
photochrome postcards. Storm surge as weather segment,
tornados on YouTube relieve us of our boredom. In the rain, 
drizzle, intermittent showers, unseasonable hurricane threatening
our flight plans, against a sea heaving photogenically,
straining at its chains like a monster in the flashbulbs, on wet stones
astonishingly slick, we take selfies, post them, and can’t undo it.

Meaning takes place in time. By elevated circumstance
of Burtynsky’s drone helicopters, revolutionary lenses
pester Alberta’s tar sands, sulphur ponds’ rhapsodic upturned faces,
photographs that happen in our name and in the name
of composition. Foreground entered at distance, the eye surveils
the McMurray Formation’s freestanding ruin mid-aspect
to an infinity of abstraction. A physical symptom assails
our vocabulary and things acquire a literal feeling from which
one does not recover. Mineral dissolution, complete. Accommodation space, 
low. Confinement, relatively broad, extremely complex stratigraphy, 
reservoirs stacked and composite. An area roughly the size
of England stripped of boreal forest and muskeg, unburdened
by hydraulic rope shovels of its overburden. Humiliated,
blinded, walking in circles. Cycle of soak and dry and residue.

The will creates effects no will can overturn, and that seem,
with the passage of time, necessary, as the past assumes a pattern.

like a heavy unconventional oil, advances. Hello infrastructure,
Dodge Ram 1500, no one else wants to get killed on Highway 63,
the all-weather road by the Wandering River where earthmovers remain
unmoved by our schedules. White crosses in the ditches,
white crosses in the glove box. The west stands for relocation, the east 
for lost causes. Would you conspire to serve tourists in a fish restaurant

on whatever and general offense and why doesn’t anyone smoke

Jackpine Mine photographs beautifully on the shoulders of the day,
in the minutes before sunset it’s still legal to hunt. One might,
like Caspar David Friedrich’s Wanderer, at a certain remove
from principal events, cut a sensitive figure in the presence
of the sublime. Except you can smell it down here. Corrosive
vapors unexpectedly distributed, caustic particulate infiltrates
your mood. As does the tar sands beetle whose bite scars, from whom
grown men run. Attracted by the same sorrowful chemical compound
emitted by damaged trees on which it feeds, its aural signature
approximates the rasp of causatum rubbing its parts together.
The only other living thing in situ, in the open pit where swims 
the bitumen, extra brilliant, dense, massive, in the Greek asphaltos,
“to make stable,” “to secure.” Pharmacist’s earth that resists decay,
resolves and attenuates, cleanses wounds. Once used to burn
the houses of our enemies, upgraded now to refinery-ready feedstock,
raw crude flowing through channels of production and distribution. 
Combustion is our style. It steers all things from the black grave
of Athabasca-Wabiskaw. Cold Lake. Rail lines of

Lac-Mégantic. The optics are bad. We’re all downstream now.
Action resembles waiting for a decision made
on our behalf, then despair after the fact. Despair which,
like bitumen itself, applied to render darker tones or an emphatic
tenebrism, imparts a velvety lustrous disposition,
but eventually discolors to a black treacle that degrades
any pigment it contacts. Details in sections of Raft of the Medusa
can no longer be discerned. In 1816, the Medusa’s captain,
in a spasm of flamboyant incompetence, ran aground
on the African coast, and fearing the ire of his constituents,
refused to sacrifice the cannons. They turned on each other,
147 low souls herded onto a makeshift raft cut loose from lifeboats
of the wealthy and well-connected. The signs were there,

risk/reward coefficient alive in the wind, the locomotive,
small tragic towns left for work, where the only thing manufactured
is the need for work. Foreshortening and a receding horizon
include the viewer in the scene, should the viewer wish
to be included in the scene. One can’t be sure if the brig, Argus,
is racing to the rescue or departing. It hesitates in the distance,
in its nimbus of fairer weather, the courage and compassion
of a new age onboard. Géricault’s pyramidical composition —
dead and dying in the foreground from which the strong succeed upward
toward an emotional peak —
an influence for Turner’s Disaster at Sea, the vortex structure of
The Slave Ship: all those abandoned, where is thy market now?

acknowledge Earth as maker & home.

Jurassic Park meets Friday meets The Pursuit of Happyness.
There should be a scene where a little black boy is playing
with a toy dinosaur on the bus, then looks out the window
& sees the T. Rex, because there has to be a T. Rex.

Don’t let Tarantino direct this. In his version, the boy plays
with a gun, the metaphor: black boys toy with their own lives,
the foreshadow to his end, the spitting image of his father.
Fuck that, the kid has a plastic Brontosaurus or Triceratops

where a cop car gets pooped on by a pterodactyl, a scene

Hmong sexy hot dude hero with a funny yet strong commanding

screamy dinosaurs. I want Cicely Tyson to make a speech, maybe two.
I want Viola Davis to save the city in the last scene with a black fist afro pick
through the last dinosaur’s long, cold-blood neck. But this can’t be
a black movie. This can’t be a black movie. This movie can’t be dismissed

because of its cast or its audience. This movie can’t be a metaphor

How to Draw a Perfect Circle,"I can imitate the spheres of the model’s body, her head,
Her mouth, the chin she rests at the bend of her elbow
But nothing tells me how to make the pupils spiral

From her gaze. Everything the eye sees enters a circle,
The world is connected to a circle: breath spools from the nostrils
And any love to be open becomes an O. The shape inside the circle

Is a circle, the egg fallen outside the nest the serpent circles
Rests in the serpent’s gaze the way my gaze rests on the model.
In a blind contour drawing the eye tracks the subject

Without observing what the hand is doing. Everything is connected
By a line curling and canceling itself like the shape of a snake
Swallowing its own decadent tail or a mind that means to destroy itself,

A man circling a railway underpass before attacking a policeman.
To draw the model’s nipples I have to let myself be carried away.
I love all the parts of the body. There are as many curves

As there are jewels of matrimony, as many whirls as there are teeth
In the mouth of the future: the mute pearls a bride wears to her wedding,
The sleeping ovaries like the heads of riders bunched in a tunnel.

The doors of the subway car imitate an O opening and closing,
In the blood the O spirals its helix of defects, genetic shadows,
But there are no instructions for identifying loved ones who go crazy.

When one morning a black man stabs a black transit cop in the face
And the cop, bleeding from his eye, kills the assailant, no one traveling
To the subway sees it quickly enough to make a camera phone witness.

The scene must be carried on the tongue, it must be carried
On the news into the future where it will distract the eyes working
Lines into paper. This is what blind contour drawing conjures in me.

At the center of God looms an O, the devil believes justice is shaped
Like a zero, a militant helmet or war drum, a fist or gun barrel,
A barrel of ruined eggs or skulls. To lift anything from a field

The lifter bends like a broken O. The weight of the body
Lowered into a hole can make anyone say Oh: the onlookers,
The mother, the brothers and sisters. Omen begins with an O.

When I looked into my past I saw the boy I had not seen in years
Do a standing backflip so daring the onlookers called him crazy.
I did not see a moon as white as an onion but I saw a paper plate

Upon which the boy held a plastic knife and sopping meat.
An assailant is a man with history. His mother struggles
To cut an onion preparing a meal to be served after the funeral.

The onion is the best symbol of the O. Sliced, a volatile gas stings
The slicer’s eyes like a punishment clouding them until they see
What someone trapped beneath a lid of water sees:

A soft-edged world, a blur of blooms holding a coffin afloat.
The onion is pungent, its scent infects the air with sadness,
All the pallbearers smell it. The mourners watch each other,

They watch the pastor’s ambivalence, they wait for the doors to open,
They wait for the appearance of the wounded one-eyed victim
And his advocates, strangers who do not consider the assailant’s funeral

Appeasement. Before that day the officer had never fired his gun
In the line of duty. He was chatting with a cabdriver
Beneath the tracks when my cousin circled him holding a knife.

The wound caused no brain damage though his eyeball was severed.
I am not sure how a man with no eye weeps. In the Odyssey
Pink water descends the Cyclops’s cratered face after Odysseus

Drives a burning log into it. Anyone could do it. Anyone could
Begin the day with his eyes and end it blind or deceased,
Anyone could lose his mind or his vision. When I go crazy

I am afraid I will walk the streets naked, I am afraid I will shout
Every fucked up thing that troubles or enchants me, I will try to murder
Or make love to everybody before the police handcuff or murder me.

Though the bullet exits a perfect hole it does not leave perfect holes
In the body. A wound is a cell and portal. Without it the blood runs
With no outlet. It is possible to draw handcuffs using loops

Shaped like the symbol for infinity, from the Latin infinitas
Meaning unboundedness. The way you get to anything
Is context. In a blind contour it is not possible to give your subject

A disconnected gaze. Separated from the hand the artist’s eye
Begins its own journey. It could have been the same for the Cyclops,
A giant whose gouged eye socket was so large a whole onion

Could fit into it. Separated from the body the eye begins
Its own journey. The world comes full circle: the hours, the harvests,
When the part of the body that holds the soul is finally decomposed

It becomes a circle, a hole that holds everything: blemish, cell,
Womb, parts of the body no one can see. I watched the model
Pull a button loose on her jeans and step out of them

As one might out of a hole in a blue valley, a sea. I found myself
In the dark, I found myself entering her body like a delicate shell
Or soft pill, like this curved thumb of mine against her lips.

You must look without looking to make the perfect circle.
The line, the mind must be a blind continuous liquid
Until the drawing is complete.",Mythology and Folklore
[Persian Letters],"Dear Aleph,

Like Ovid: I’ll have no last words.
This is what it means to die among barbarians. Bar bar bar
was how the Greeks heard our speech —
sheep, beasts — and so we became
barbarians. We make them reveal
the brutes they are, Aleph, by the things
we make them name. David,
they tell me, is the one
one should aspire to, but ever since
I first heard them say Philistine
I’ve known I am Goliath
if I am anything.",Mythology and Folklore
Phrasis,"Stilled as in image, at dawn sliding into
blue harbor, boats clang, where does he
the man I imagine gripping several ropes
return from. Is he conflicted, does he
perceive the sky oscillating like
a dimmer machine, a mouth, a war, language
not declaring its most
effective self, bellum grazing ever
nearer to beauty, a possible apotheosis how
what is left of sense
is comfort. Not inebriated much anymore,
I rented a lawn to stand in with you, crueler
was always singing to our mutual forks,
knives. Our translation
of a subject drones
on unblinking, something black for him
returning, his forearms there laid
themselves down, ships gone out another
pale-plated night.",Mythology and Folklore
The Poet,"As P strolled the path around the pond, he sniffed the humid air. His kimono brushed the parched ground. The metals of the earth rose up in traces of dust and hints of lightning: a waft of petrichor, the smell before the rain.

Beyond the pale hills of his peaceful land, scores of horse soldiers prepared their armor. Soon the soldiers would sweep across the plains, and the dry politics of princely maneuverings would be as rice paper soaked with blood. Instead of petty policies — immensity. Peaceful farmers would be impaled, paltry officials imprisoned — twisted, screaming, then praying. There on the dusty path the young poet P was just perceiving the beforeness of it all, the pre-.

From his masters he had learned that immensity makes the small crucial. A little poem before a big war becomes a necessity.

And like a small poem on a long scroll, a lily pad appeared on the pond. P stopped to peer. He puzzled through its pattern of green inside green on water.

A poem began to perfuse. It was inside P, but it was also on the lily pad.

At    ...    On    ...    At first only prepositions came to him.

He stared into the water, seeing the silvery clouds reflected. Then he leaned at an extreme angle and noticed the pattern of his gown wavering in the reeds. A pinpoint of a poem stabbed him, like the sharp scent of earth before the rain. Petrichor: before, before.

•

Then drops pelted the pond, pipped at the pond, plunged toward it, plummeted into it, driving P to take refuge beneath the deep tiled eaves of his house.

Inside the sliding paper doors were a desk and a futon. On the desk lay a brush. On the futon lay a lover in uneasy sleep on petal-printed silk.

He chose the desk. He lifted the brush while looking down at the restive slumberer. In a mere matter of stopped time he had his poem, written from the very tissues of an arm and hand that could plunge a sword.
Silver soldiers mass
on far horizons, but here,
silk pools on the bed.
The rain rained; moisture curled the edges of the paper. Seventeen syllables, an epic of energy, made him drowsy and hungry. His lover still asleep, he rose, ate leftover peaches poached in soy sauce and ginger, and, with the rain a drizzle, thought again of his poem. How could he have loved it in the instant after he wrote it, but now be so unsure?

He sat at his desk again. Another one? This time he drafted:
Poppy? Penis up.
Prow into periwinkle.
Peony behind.
After he calligraphed the puzzle of passion across the page, he woke the one in the pond of pink silk, and they proved it on the futon. He heard the pluvial patter on the eaves, while they angled and slipped, perspiring on silk. The stamping and snorting of the horses sweating in their armor was far too far away to be sensed by P, but he heard. He felt the pond muddied and the roof cracked and the poems scattered. How far was he now from this picture in his mind? He worked to make his pleasure stay, pitiable and small against the portents rising, for P was afraid this afternoon would never be remembered after the bloody conquering.

But later the barbarians would bivouac in this house, the pond saved for drinking water, the path roughened by horses, and the reverse of P’s scroll used for another man’s military diary, his afternoon’s foreboding and pleasure a preparation for the future, and in the future, a stay against another’s view of the past.

The Boley Rodeo,"A collective family myth
passed down across generations
takes on the polished gleam of truth,
and memories become legend.

The legend of black sod-busters
on a piece of red soil they own
in a township of black ranchers.
Their legendary rodeo.

grand entry

Two Stars and Stripes flutter into
the arena, carried by two
men in jeans, red shirts, white Stetsons.
Guiding their horses with left hands,
holding the flagstaffs in their rights,
their backs straight and tall, their faces,
their chestnut faces, beautiful
in the light of the setting sun.

After them, two by two,
banners waving, hooves raising dust,
ride the Horse People of Boley,
a varicolored promenade.
They canter once around the ring,
then they circle into the sky.

mutton busting

In the cluster of five-year-old
contenders wearing life jackets
and bicycle helmets, paper
numbers safety-pinned to their backs,
you line up one by one for a turn
to hang on tight with your legs squeezed
at the sheep’s broad middle, fingers
holding handfuls of deep, warm wool
as the sheep destiny presents
runs you out to cheering applause.
Whether you’ll fall on top of it,
or it on you, you won’t fall far.
You have no front teeth anyway,
and a brown clown gone pick you up.

bareback riding

This horse was bred and born to buck.
He’s a good horse, he’ll give you points.
Gloved hand in the rigging’s handle,
bare brown hand waving in the air,
you whir your spurs at his shoulders
as he leaps, twists, and jolts your bones.
Four seconds or four hundred years.
But if you can get up and slap
the dust off your jeans with your hat,
the future’s eyes, looking at you,
will fill with forevering light:
light that will make generations
of proud brown people remember
the Black Horse People of Boley.

bulldogging

In truth there’s seldom a reason
for a man to wrestle a steer,
unless he’s a real ranch cowboy
dealing with ornery power.
Maybe, while rounding up the herd,
he bumps heads with testosterone,
and it’s testosterone-vs.-
testosterone. Bill Pickett learned,
watching dogs on a Boley ranch,
that sometimes you’ve got to bulldog
a hardhead with a kiss of pain.
Today, you slide from horse onto
the fleeing steer, grab his horns, pull
five hundred pounds of muscle down.

team roping, calf roping, steer roping

Roping always involves a team,
whether it’s two men or women
or one human and one smart horse.
The aim: to bring down and hog-tie
a big scared baby of a calf
or a full-grown and pissed-off steer.
You gallop out swinging your loop
with one hand, the other holding
the slack and the unneeded reins.
You down him with a careful toss,
tie three of his hooves together,
step back with wide arms and a grin.
A rope isn’t always a noose:
ropes in brown hands can be lassos.

saddle bronc riding

It’s not the leather riding gloves
and it’s not the fringed buckskin chaps,
not the worn-in and dusty boots,
not the spurs’ blunted silver stars,
not the 10x wide-brimmed straw hat
(both winged helmet and regal crown):
it’s not clothes that make the cowboy.
It’s something behind a bronzed face,
in the level gaze from dark eyes,
and, of course, it’s heart that puts you,
the reins in one hand, one hand free,
waving with the horse’s rhythm,
your heels spurring from neck to flank,
on this bronc called America.

barrel racing

Thunder explodes out of the chute.
Mane and tail whip in the speed wind,
agile hooves pound a swift tempo
circling around the first barrel.
One hand grips the horn, the other
communicates with the taut reins,
though your thighs give the best guidance,
telling your horse to maneuver
in circles that hug the barrels.
Three barrels, a tight cloverleaf
you gallop through with one joined will.
This contest pits you and your horse
against the clock and your best time.
Sister, your dreadlocks are flying!

pony express

Before telegraph, news traveled
from mouth to ear, from hand to hand.
News arrived old. From sea to sea
took weeks, unless carried by boys
stationed along the stagecoach route
to race a cross-country relay.
Your pulse gallops toward the handoff,
when your teammate takes the baton
and the noise and flurry go on
without you. Your leg run, you and
your horse (your partner, your friend) stand
encompassed in adrenalin,
watching, as the Ancestors must,
unable to help, but cheering.

tennessee walker

Let’s hear it for the barrel men,
for the bullfighters, for the clowns,
for the men on the side ready
to run toward trouble. Give it up
for the musical director
(thanks for the hip-hop, bro!). And for
the announcer and all the folks
cheering in the stands. That baby
wearing a tiny cowboy hat.
That man the same black as his horse,
in that white suit and fedora.
His Tennessee Walker’s proud gait
as he nods to his own rhythm,
tail an ebony waterfall.

bull riding

Boley bulls are bred for bucking,
bred to be mean, to be “Bad Boys.”
They teach you to sit strong, hold on,
and with one hand reach for the sky.
After riding a Boley bull
a cowboy thinks, Hell, I’ve been there.
I’ve held the bull-rope, raked my spurs,
while that bad boy tried to kill me.
A ton of Brahma seeing red
gives you a whole new perspective,
a who-you-think-you-talking-to
fearlessness. You’ve seen the bull’s eye:
you know you can’t die more than once.
You’ve lived through eight Mississippis.",Nature

on the pedal. a fake gold chain on my neck. i confess
i’m a sucker. i never want magicians to reveal their secrets.
i want to live in the unknowing where everything is possible.

me her baby still. perspective is a magic trick. i hit my brother
with the Rock Bottom & i bet you can guess what i leave out.

the poets are right about the moonlight.
i take my spot of sky & deposit it
into a savings account. only after
the bank confiscated our house
did i understand. roses
don’t grow without pricked hands.
i didn’t have to spend a summer in a freezer
packing lunch meat to know the value
of sunlight. my mom didn’t have
to spend a decade wiping down floors to appreciate
education. when i give you a bouquet of roses,
i give you a bouquet of bloody hands.
a handful of dirt & the worms that doted on your roses.
when i take my piece of sky out of the bank,
it’s smaller. the drunks are right about moonshine.

miss her chance. Nobody else, let’s face it, cared about metaphor, or even simile, the like-it-or-not-ness of the mountain pretty much getting between a body and her musing, in its going. One

step at a time, anyone could lose herself or someone else just staring at her feet. And if a body meet a body is not mere speech but something that could happen, like hopping a bus—though on the mountain

you’ll catch no rides, worse luck, the mountain requires to be climbed on foot, one after the other, nothing else will get you up it. There’s nothing like such obduracy but in the wild, nobody can tell you otherwise. No simple figure,

Our earth can’t live without holy rites.
You can see this from the sky.

Lots of hills to climb up and down.
A straight ravine between.

Snow figures engraved in stones.
Show streaks of sun gone but
The white rocks shrink and grow
Grave at sunset.



Turn to the right
And you will fall to the left.

Down to his chest

But Eros hates coverings.
And prefers to be caught naked

With his bow and arrow.

But clears the way for pathos.

From above I covet a mountain beneath my feet.

Shrines made of dung and branches,
With berries for eyes and burlap hung with holly.
They were curled in shadows on roads
Leading to every stop we made from the Trig

To Top Withens to Liverpool.
The white and purple mountains.
Stood over the Brontës and clusters
Of black thistles’ script.

I remember a church (a cave supported
By old bicycle parts to keep it up)
Was bound by a broken bell and a box
Containing snapshots and trinkets.

Why mercy?

Having mercy on someone is easier than forgiving them.

That one there?

A man limited by logic, he imprisoned the people whose thinking was infinite.

And her, the serious one?

Stars without light hold the others up.

I lost you for a moment.

Mid-sentence is darker so you can’t decipher it.
Look up.

Oyster, shell pink, sky inside. Our prison.

What would you tell the judge?

The difference between a man who shoots others and then himself and one who shoots others and runs away.

You will tell her that decisions are only guesses.
“Resentment is a weak form of suicide.”

That’s why suicide is hard to choose even when you’re dying.
“I wish they would shoot themselves before they shot the others.”

We’ve evolved (arrived) just in time for the obsolete.

The center that runs along the sides of the tarmac
Is a camp without a name.
A holding station.

For each passenger of any class.

explanation of something not clear?”

“It’s also persecution and surrender,
Translation and the handing over
Of prisoners to countries
Where detention is.”

Will only burn your bed-skins.

Now the wing is whitening, its patches quiver
on the steel and fragment into petals that are either living or not.
In grade one I watched the lights of cars passing on the bedroom wall
for surely they were messages flying at the speed of light.

There is a wonderful kidnapped hunted raped and betrayed girl
In fairy tales. She has a name, but the vowels and subjects
Around can’t be switched to fit.

She wants to escape but letters won’t let her.

And don’t require thought.

What if the outcome of an act burst into color.
All that fruit skin dimpled from the touch of branches.
The oranges falling when the creatures below were hungry.

Each wink of an eyelid presaged a long look at a winter

What if you think of time as a long and everlasting plain,
You can pass across it any which way you turn.
And walk around the pond with your father again.

I had a garden of my own
For twenty-one years.
Seven trees times three
Planted for the first children.

Oh its land was a meadow
And our little house, a grape arbor
And a Wampanoag
Grave in a grove of elms.

Then a tree like an elephant
Bucked in a storm.
And its trunk broke into
A wrinkled little stump.

Roots don’t give up.

And stones only breathe once a year.

Many people passed through.
We could have watered more
Or flowered a path
For the visitors. After all

Love meant life and its shadow.
Children played and grew.
I too grew old for no reason.
Love stood at a distance.

One day the snow will camouflage
The huddling April buds
Before a cherry-picker
Damns all but one, the littlest.

Fly from Sepiessa.
They herd the future
As it approaches the bench.

At Town Hall is creaking
And tribal members
Now numbered

In the twos are too early for sun-up.


We almost sit together
But our feet of shadows
Show failed land deals.
Steps lowered and slimy

On a slip into the lagoon.
Ghoulish are the ghosts
Of time past: ancestors
With our same names.

Pensées sauvages: wild pansies, like violets, have the shape of thoughts, savage thoughts, colored thoughts, sprung from a stem.

It’ll Get Worse Before It Gets Worse,"For Alexander Moysaenko

through the trees from here.

Where are you?

I’m alone on the road
with a dead phone.

The birds are flapping overhead
but there’s not much light to be guided by.

If any horizon becomes visible enough to follow.

Forget the rain’s smear,
the chafe of fabric at the calf.

The money ran out. The diners are stuffed
and back for more.

Each terrible thing I said to the child
will get repeated hopefully as a joke.

And like language, these gestures, or a certain way of nodding
one’s head, it all eases in with less than a breath.

Forget the song’s words, the order of the band’s set tonight.

The black moon’s heart’s
got that sinister bent
and I want to get
touched at by the snakes.

One of the students in my class
used to go bear hunting with his two uncles.

They played recordings of distressed animals
to lure in tentative animals to kill.

This practice is illegal in many places.
Because it’s so very effective.

2. exo-statisticians change minds, cite insufficiency of planetary bodies of right type

What, no aliens? Or, with greater dignity,
life elsewhere in the universe? That window’s
shut, we learn. Astronomers, indignant

desert birds, eyes screwed to the long cinder-
scuttles of their telescopes, will voice some doubt,
one hopes! This is too lonely. Heliocentric

humility’s a habit hard to shake. Endowed
with what we’ve called “intelligence,” or “powerful
intelligence,” like-minded creatures, each an end-

point in a home-world’s evolutionary raffle,
well, just must across the vasty deeps of space
and time yearn forth to find each other with awful

big radios. That’s how the Book of Revelations
we knew used to read, rephrased so, pi be praised.

My friend the geometer, when asked if pi

pi’s the pontification of a ratio.

that in a well-formed sentence, well, that’s human, sure.
All language is. So ever since that fateful shore

of Lake Turkana where tongue forked, where first
flaking syntax split the atom into force

and mass, thing and verb, the copula
has groped to reanneal it: this opulence

is equal to the sum of those simplicities ...

surface of the water a salt of stars

4. prose obtrusions concerning the keats equation

Hold it there.

Would you say truth’s a property of sentences, but beauty’s not?

So that mysterious predictive gift of mathematics is precisely that of sentences like I predict the sun will rise tomorrow?—isn’t that the leap that left the chimpanzees behind?—and adding time of sunrise just adds increment to the precision?

So that Platonic realm where Mathematics must exist to be discovered by Ramanujan or Hardy or Arcturans tucked in anywhere in time or space is just that space where earlier equations live, like love’s a rose or tears are rain, which Hardy’s and Ramanujan’s respective ancestors discovered independently?

That if in England two men feed a horse, the horse stays thin, the axiom would hold as well for two Tibetan yaks or fat Jurassic stegosaurs (assuming less that that’s what the Arcturans use to carry mail than that, like us, they pinch their pence)—

That that’s the realm where poems and equations likewise lie unspoken, quietly awaiting their discovery?

And so those famous instances where mathematics efflorescing on some blackboard purely for the play of it turn out to have a shocking congruence with patterns in the world is just exactly like the case where poetry is news before the news it stays?

That hadn’t the acclaimed predictive potency of mathematics best be cast as a reminder of forgotten shock—the shock our shaggy kind must once have felt, framing for the first time well-formed sentences about the world that was, and then about the world about to be, and so extended human sensibility and thrust it forth as backward through the night of time?

Yes, if diffidently.

Hymn to Edmond Albius,"Too busy peddling my fire and trying to keep the mouths fed
and packing up belongings of the recent dead right now to access
your luxurious philosophy, though one looks forward to a time

when the universe permits, I said to my electric correspondent
who came at me puffed pink in thoughtfulness when what I needed
then as now was a quiet high enough to envision a half-gallon

brick of all-natural vanilla ice cream softening on the hot hood
of an idling cop car: the earliest rivulets, a slow loss of strict
rectangularity, then the wild gliding around on the beautiful bleak

enamel paint job as its sweet fragrance fills the air like a gift
from Madagascar I can breathe. Rapt Cortés transported cuttings
of vanilla across the Atlantic during his plunder of the Aztecs;

the Aztecs themselves fell captive to its magic after vanquishing
its first cultivators the Totonacs, who paid their conquerors tributes
of baskets stacked to heaven with cured vanilla pods like long

sentences of salutiferous essence. This is one of those instances
history likes to push your face into to try to stir your appetite
for cruelty a little, or at least make you covet the perks of it: I too

want vanilla in quantity. I want it all around me, like a fortress
of mellow dangles. It will move with me as I move and it will ward
hateful people off. For centuries Europeans tried to cultivate it

outside its native Mexico and failed. They could get the vine
to flower, but in the absence of ancestral pollinators, specifically
hummingbirds and a stingless bee, the flowers dropped off podless.

Meanwhile, Edmond Albius—born into slavery on an island
east of Madagascar known then as Bourbon, lush French colony
and home to roses, one active volcano, one dormant, and one

arena-like caldera that holds the record for most rainfall shed
in one location by a single tropical cyclone ever, namely Hyacinthe—
knew enough from orchids at age twelve in 1841 to think to lift

with a bamboo splint the flap of the rostellum dividing the pollen-
heavy male anther from the female stigma in order to rub the pollen
on the stigma’s eager wand. Within weeks the pods had begun

to form and lengthen into joyous beanlike squiggles laden with
tiny seeds like secrets of the universe as Albius at the shore and under
bright southern stars breathed out I hope in a kind of enlargement

akin to liberty from time, so that on that occasion he might feel
briefly as if his own, even as his method of vanilla pollination
belonged first to his master, then Madagascar, and then the world,

with nearly all vanilla produced today as Albius taught us, including
the kind in Breyers since 1866, fourteen years before Albius died
unrecognized, in poverty, in misery to be exact, while everyone white

around him grew rich with vanilla, adding it to candy, Coca-Cola,
Chanel No. 5, and even in effigy to the air freshener dangling
down in my Uber, its waves whispering Albius, Albius, but inaudibly.",Nature

When I Die,"We shelter an angel whom we never cease to offend. We ought to be the guardians of that angel.
—Jean Cocteau
A scherzo of thumbnail butterflies, white ones,
Covers the hillside. God is more
Adorable than music. Nevertheless,
On a given morning, as the wind drops,
Music pries Heaven apart from itself,
Like flowers beneath the wings unfolded on them.

Every breeze is self-registering.
This morning, I walked deeper into the hill,
Free of the sun. Midway up the tallest trees,
One leaf alone would stir while all the leaves
On the very same branch remained stock-still.
Apart from itself, Heaven signaled to me.

William Blake was no romantic. He was,
Beyond the arsons of levity and his toe,
The final bulwark of the baroque.
He was the last to oppose, “almost
Successfully,” rebirth on all the wrong terms.
He saw the leaf alone where no light was.

Infinite variation plays against
A steadfast variety. The butterfly
Knows the difference in its wings, even
As the flower she alights upon darkens
Beneath her weight. The sun goes deeper
Into the hill. Root systems and riot shine.

Did you think for a moment Earth
Was aware of itself? Never. Its adoration
Persists altogether elsewhere from
The very beginning, beginning again
Just at that moment one leaf all alone
Spins into the baroque, a scherzo of one note.

The hillside is covered with little doors,
And the wind rises out of them, returning,
When the music is spent, with all the news
Of the unaware, unreflecting, nearly perfect
Hours blindly about the business of perfection.
Hence the tiny eyes on a butterfly’s wing.

Rebirth is an idiot. Isolated
Each into its own eternity,
Like every pain, birth continues out of mind
Deeper into the hill. Earth riots
With levity. Darkness swims into light.
Flowers begin to imagine the life of flowers.

Heaven signals to me, pouring down shade
Out of the canopy of trees, prying
The sunlight apart from itself. Darkness
And light are the same thing. Music moves
Effortlessly between the two, made of nothing
But wings, wings with eyes, no end in sight.",Nature

Black Coffin with Milk,"Take the measure of wooden speech with a wooden tongue
The sound waves crash in, like a handful of grasshoppers
Take the nails and bang them into the weeping painting
The kids are shouting what they’re for: it’s making noise
Making noise and drinking milk with a magnifying glass

The ancestor’s dead from reading books and breathing
From boxing vegetables and reading books and breathing
The cardboard boxes are in his brain in tiny mirroring bits
From the vein in his forehead to the vein in his toe they run
They run like children to the school milk and the myths

Out of the crush they would say of him, mad as a string
The trees would say different of course when they saw him
Out of grace, they never were, they would mimic Umback
The leaves in his hair were the marks of a bush comedy
A bush comedy so good it could run forever without seats

The little version of the novel, every novel he read at night
That he played out with his bosses, with strangers, his wife
The wife has another ancestor with the same name, related
That the lightning spilled down the hill in hot liquid form
A form that was repeated and parodied in the hill’s plants

Take this string and wrap it round the painting as if alive
As if alive and attempting to survive out there in the bush
Take the clock and time the boy who went to get the milk
As if you can get milk from a large white rabbit that makes
The sound of death, chewing grasshoppers like a machine",Nature
Crepuscule with Paula,"Does realism get your vote? It gets mine.
The plants with their insatiable thirst for appearances,
the heart-stopping 7:00 p.m. air moonlighting as a pressed-cardboard Korean ashtray
(server, modest coaster) decorated with a single blondish branch
holding six leaves and a piece of rose-colored fruit (pear, plum, ripe peach)
slightly raised as if applied to the flat, creamy space behind
flecked with light gray, light green, and brown marks of varying size
from pinpricks to ashes, pencil (it looks like) to brush.
The romance of the windowpanes (I’m squinting a little) has nothing
to do with the misguided view, the one with the Fates schmoozing
under the maroon awning of the high-rise (schmoos is more like it)
and the embarrassed-looking sycamores revealing for all they’re worth
in their slightly fictionalized but emotionally accurate way, which contributes to the overall tone
without detracting from the realistic participation,
a motorbike taking the corner too fast, a cat knowing the worst that can possibly happen and managing to avoid it,
which could be the key signature if not for a free-standing
radiance just outside, unmoored, a hint of plum or Anjou pear.",Nature
George Smiley,"in the cornfield along with the husks and splintered baseball bats

Little Bird,"I sang all night for you, but you didn’t care. You were too sad. Little bird, I said to myself, you can’t bring anybody back, but maybe you can keep him here. I thought you liked my song. But I couldn’t tell now. You looked angry, but you stayed in the room where I sang. I inherited the song. Not from my parents. Not from my grandmother. My grandfather doesn’t sing. My song was mine and I thought you liked it. I thought you loved me. Now you showed no sign of loving anything. But you stayed in the room all night. The room was full of statues with coins under their tongues. I felt bad for building them. Some don’t even have names. Sylvia, Ian, Anne, Emily, Seb. You barely moved. Sometimes, you moved. Little bird, I told myself, little bird, pretending I was you, I love you. Please sing for me. I didn’t want you to leave. I kept singing.

Near-Earth Object,"Unlike the monarch, though
the asteroid also slipped
quietly from its colony
on its annular migration
between Jupiter and Mars,
enticed maybe by
our planetary pollen
as the monarch by my neighbor’s
slender-leaved milkweed.
Unlike it even when
the fragrant Cretaceous
atmosphere meteorized
the airborne rock,
flaring it into what might
have looked to the horrid
triceratops like a monarch
ovipositing (had the butterfly
begun before the period
broke off). Not much like
the monarch I met when I
rushed out the door for the 79,
though the sulfurous dust
from the meteoric impact
off the Yucatán took flight
for all corners of the heavens
much the way the next
generation of monarchs
took wing from the milkweed
for their annual migration
to the west of the Yucatán,
and their unburdened mother
took her final flit
up my flagstone walkway,
froze and, hurtling
downward, impacted
my stunned peninsular

shapely and true. Let me tell you. To feel a thought one came up with one’s self.
Out of one’s interiority. There. That’s the whole story. If humanity. If to hang on claw

might find some emptiness. From mind. Lean in & you’ll hear plenitude. Listen it’s trying

An Apprehension,"Ten below, high of zero, 4:11 pm
flashed the alarm panel’s handsome blue touchscreen.

Without commotion or fire the afternoon
passed slowly, full of promise,

then disappointment.
Without heartbreak or break-in.

For company I had Kafka on my lap
and Qolsys vibrating lightly against the wall.

4:34    ...    4:35    ...
There are all sorts of creatures in the world, I read,

wretched, limited, dumb creatures
who have no language but mechanical cries.

I stood up and stretched.
Face-to-face with Qolsys,

I peered into the sensors, into the little hole
of the siren, and touched up my lipstick.

Maybe I can ask Dave to come back, I thought,
Dave from Royal Security,

Dave with the smoky brown eyes,
maybe he can help.

I took off my slippers,
my bargain-basement bra, and danced.

Silence. Not even a mechanical cry —
I wondered if the fault were mine.

Maybe I miswired the hard data?
The soft data?

Maybe the poor thing simply had no loins.
I opened the window.

Window opening, said Qolsys
in a low persuasive voice.

Outside there were heavy birds
weighing down the winter trees,

heaps of them in the gloaming, almost purple,
waiting for what, who can say?

I shut the window.
Window closing, said Qolsys.

It was a start, not so very different from others of my species,
narrating events as they happen,

I’m coming,
I’m coming —

I opened the window again,
letting the cold air press across my wrists,

the back of my neck, my lips, hoping
at least the motion detector, inside,

or the birds, outside,
would respond to the scent that pulsed there.

You will not go unsampled! I heard the birds say.
Be mine! I heard the trees say.

I could have shut the window,

Idée Fixe,"No woman wants to be low-hanging fruit,
my glamorous girlfriend says, but I’m indiscriminate
and love all fruit, I’m tempted to list each kind
right here, in and out of season,
because even just saying the names gives me pleasure,
as does saying your name.
I’m not alone with my passion — my whole family,
we’re a little off in this regard,
we can spend hours talking about cantaloupe
or arguing over how many flats to buy
when it’s Peach-O-Rama at the Metropolitan.
Once I even drove half a day to get to Pence Orchards
where I met and took photos of Bert Pence,
who sold me three boxes of peaches at wholesale prices.
He was so good to me, as was the late-summer freestone
I picked as I walked back through the orchard
in the August heat to the entrance gates,
which were nothing like the Gates of Hell.
On the contrary, I was in heaven there in Yakima.
I can still smell that single peach, which was profusely
low-hanging, it was the definition of low-hanging,
it fell into my hands, as you did —
or perhaps as I did into yours —
but that was months ago.
When I walked past the stands yesterday,
on what should have been the first day of spring,
all produce had been covered with heavy blankets
to keep it warm, to mitigate harm.
Today the temperature dropped so low
someone thought to remove the fruit entirely and stash it away.

Your little fingers opening an apple opening

A box fan instead of air conditioning

Kids curled up on the coating

An earwig floats by another earwig

The day listens to traffic moving off in two directions at once like

I think the day knows exactly what it’s doing

Opening a stuck window or collecting a small fee




But also you see something out the window I don’t see

Moss grows you can count on it

Morning dew scratched at the door then cantered away into what
             we’re not sure of

I filtered everything through rain and got what exactly
             more rain?

The good news is ferns

The good news is graffiti

Not only recycling but holding hands in a holding pattern the day

The next thing you know the rain has stopped

And starts again before you know it with a drop and a drop and yet

A cup of coffee on the counter

The dogs in the backyard in a lather

A cell phone tower via a pine tree

The newly emptied mall parking lot via a lake

I got here late

Wildstyle via FatCap along the chain link was red and yellow spray

Margarine via butter

The sound of the interstate via the sound of the sea

Dogs melt into the linoleum

Wheal Emma Leat,"Wheal Emma and Brookwood are abandoned copper mines whose remains are located near Buckfastleigh, within the Dartmoor National Park, an area with a long history of widespread industrial activity. From this one locality, in the second half of the nineteenth century, more than thirty thousand tons of copper ore were raised, processed, and shipped for smelting. In 1859, in order to stabilize and increase the power supply, Wheal Emma Leat (a fifteen-mile-long channel) was cut across moorland and around woodland valleys to transport water from the River Swincombe and to feed the mines by supplementing the Mardle, a tributary of the Dart. Some of this now empty moorland waterway can be walked today on Dartmoor. I am grateful to Kevin and Donna Cox, owners of the Brook Manor estate, for showing my collaborator, Ignacio Acosta, and me over the remains of mine workings on their land.

Widening the plug doorway
on the bob wall left no
surface evidence. The Mardle
has a floodplain fair and wide.
Material would have been
trammed directly, although
blacked ochreous water flows
freely from the collapsed
portal. Humphrey kept Kevin
back when we went into
the near horizontal dark adit
stooped at the panic shaft.

In Brook Wood at the combe
head is a small killas quarry
predating all three setts.
Rent was paid to the Brook Wood
adventurers. Three areas of
dumping partially covered
this crumbled masonry within
woodland of varying density
just south of the tarmac road.
Yet a leat is depicted on the
1886 OS map channeled entirely
in a raised wooden aqueduct.

Then buildings fall into decay
where ivy and tree growth
have taken hold. The silted channel
follows the contour round hills
and combes using the best-fit
method to Wheal Emma sett.
Whereas conifer scrub and dense
patches of rhododendron
are seen quite late in the sequence.
All 99 stations were used and
having passed over the wheel
water may have been diverted.

The long wheelhouse sides are not
straight but slightly kinked to provide
for a dished 60-ft wheel
over an arched tailrace exit
at floor level. In this same evening
were those people engaged to feast
on roast beef and strong ale nearby.
Within the valley of the holy brook
the mines are situated near
Buckfastleigh, crushed ores are hauled
for the South Wales copper smelters,
Alfred Jenkin their agent in Cornwall.

Over and over had they been
in the heaven of expectation
finding the ore ground pitched eastward;
those who gambled their lives in swift
currents and dark treacherous pools.
Granting two properties as
one sett at a royalty of 1/24
together with fine machinery,
wheels, a beam engine, and water
privileges. One hundred and twenty-
five workers being then separated
only by a small transverse valley.

The flat rods moved off so quietly
that those not looking were unconscious
of their being in motion. Steam was
employed only at limited scale.
Emma, 116 fathoms below adit,
pumping backed-up water for life itself:
men cutting lode in fume- and dust-ridden air
or crushing with hand tools, spalling, cobbing,
came our tramroad to harbor direct
in Totnes and thence by sea to Neath —
no more windlass or horse-whim turning.
What you see here is the dressing floor.

Their Phoenician purple dye —
their copper with fifteen percent
Cornish tin. Remember when
a solid solution of
metal elements was defined
by ecstatic bonding.
Water poured over its surface
producing hydrogen gas.
The new material is
stable and ready for use
but scaled-up production
could fuel cannibal drones.

  Green Pool, 2017, by Ignacio Acosta.


We love the color and
the stillness. Nothing would
live in this water now
at the base of a spoil heap
two stories high. Worm casts
and broadly scattered pits
are laminated onto a
non-conductive substrate.
This is the green pool:
a water soak away
made from glass epoxy.

They are brown and green
like uneven flat loaves
and the museum label
reads tortas de cobre.
Moss grows on anything
like black flame retardant
mechanically supports and
electrically connects —
the fenced-off shaft
protecting the river
from what leaches out
between sea-borne traders.

At these horizons the levels were
extended over 330 fathoms.
Small groups of self-employed
miners and their families
continued to migrate. Here was
alluvial gold mixed with
sand and gravel, producing
more than 14 heads of stamps were
capable of crushing. Composed
of quartz, peach, and gossan with black
and yellow copper letting down
a stream of mineralized water.

For in much of this section
the leat had been cut from
solid rock. A stone-lined sluice
is just visible. 4,000 shares
on the cost book system,
streamworks in eluvial ground,
5 shillings each deposit. Nothing
but a washing strake such as
we use, commodified and priced
both minerals since the Bronze Age
in West Devon, in Cornwall
beneath a layer of black sand.

An adit is also brought home
to the spot from below: narrow
tailings in steep profile cast
every shovel full as it rises
into a tye. £40,000 worth
of copper ore from above
the 50-fathom level.

… Bee,"I stood in a longhouse
with a woman who may or may not
be Mohawk. Some shift their opinions
about her like meteorologists, as if
her blood were a storm system tracked
in its comings and goings. But the father
of her two sons was, without question, Seneca.
We knew that, in Haudenosaunee country, a father
is to some degree irrelevant, that her own
shifting identity would impact her sons’ lives
like a gene vulnerable to betrayal, causing
certain, terminal conditions. She waited
on an elder she called Steam (warning I was not
to call the elder woman by that name). Steam
(not Steam) would observe the boys, understand
their natures, give them their Creator names defining
their lives during the next ceremony. I confessed
my namelessness, confessed my longhouse- and fluency-
deficient community, and confessed that my clan
mother, three hours away, did not know me well
enough to give me a name, confessed my community followed
a more casual ceremony. You find your name after a social misstep,
a dubious facial feature, a birth defect. Names offer
the name-givers comfort, that your challenge is harder
than theirs, no matter the truth.

Our names are a convoluted toughening of our skins. My name
is not like Steam (no one is forbidden to use it). No one
calls me Batman because of my status, my utility
belt, my impressive batpole, my agility, my muscles,
my profile in spandex, my virtues, but because I wore
the cape to an older age than I should have, and could
continue to wear it now, as that shit is not going away
any time soon. Even kids who only know Christian Bale
or Michael Keaton, lurking in latex and leather hood,
still think Batman is my name.

And this is why I have no memory for when or how you became
the Bumblebee, what it means, beyond the literal.
You soar in gardens, spend days ensuring growth,
and if metaphors are at work here, this one seems true
enough to keep you in amber wings, fuzzy yellow rings,
black lacquer torso, and sensitive antennae.

What metaphor suits the night I left on the Amtrak
for Chicago, past 1:00 a.m., while you stood
on the platform, watching those cars pull out,
the night I wanted to leap from the train, stay?

I cannot invent new names for the ways we slow,
struggle, attempt to maintain the illusion of futures
without measure, defy actuary numbers and because I have
gone closer to the light than you have, the story is
easier to craft and finesse than it should be.

The submarine’s inside was dim.
— Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, tr. by Will Petersen
in my youth, I hitched a ride to San Diego, across
chirping desert and distant night, I gazed upon a slow-moving
dark, encasing a convex cerulean cavity

each night, I stood beneath the sky for hours mesmerized
at the perplex reformatory, twinkling lights of broken
glass fragments spreading against a glistening sunset

a faceless man behind a lost reflection of glass
at a drive-up window informs me,
too bad, you know nothing of your own past

how far will I walk against the night?
conforming to a captivity I had never realized

some years later, under the kitchen table, they all huddle,
as the rampage continues toward the back of the house,
a clash of debris from the other room recoils
and broken sounds escape the barricade of doors

I don’t understand this kindergarten
assignment: “Draw Your Clan.”
The three letters live in abstraction.
A friend suggests mine looks like his, minus
legs, and that day I believe my clan is
a species of amputee Snipes, birds
forced to fly the skies forever, and I
wonder if we are meant to symbolize
endurance or something beyond
my five-year-old comprehension.

My mother explains we are not legless
birds and if she had a more worldly
vocabulary she would have suggested
we were ambiguous, not quite a fish,
more than a water snake, but she says
we are among the few. The last Tuscarora Eel
died out a generation ago, so we are left
Onondaga Eels among the Tuscarora,
voiceless as well as legless.

I find an encyclopedia photo,
see jagged rows of razor teeth
in a mouth perpetually grinning
and when I show it to her, she says
clans are a system to keep track
of families, so we don’t inadvertently
marry our relatives, and that we have no
more affinity with eels than anyone else
on the reservation has with their animals.

“If I threw you in the dike,” she says
“you’d drown as fast as anyone else,” done
with this lesson. I remember older cousins,
swimming between my legs, and suddenly I am rising,
their hands grabbing my knees as my balls collide
with the backs of their necks, and they break
the surface, toss me into deeper water, probably
watching to make sure I surface, after they’ve had
some amusement at my struggle.

In wet darkness, I imagine opening
my eyes and mouth, taking water in,
filling my lungs, discovering gills
like Aquaman or Namor, the Sub-mariner.
Knowing I had better odds of dying, face down,
no voice to call out for help, I am
never quite brave enough to try it, not daring
enough, even, to open my eyes when my face breaks
the stillness of river water contained.


6

But I flip on my back, ears below the surface, listen
to mysteries, breathe shallowly at that level, and float,
wondering what it would be like to glide the depths
on fins, knowing if I were there, I would desire
legs and lungs, and then I fill my chest to capacity,
and dive, loving and begrudging the ache I find there,
the throbbing of my chest begging for release,
and I swim back up, eyes still closed, wondering how
long it will take to find the surface again.",Nature

From “Love Letter to the Future: A Book of the Land in Eight Acts”,"act 1, scene 1: do you know what it means for our survival?

Fog spun into silk
              on the knee of the comptroller,
              propelled toward the crest of Ontario,
              the old, faded star, steambreath onto the windshield.

To orient in the finest sense
              of cackles, mute chrysanthemums,
              funneling inordinate nakedness,
              absorbed, absorbed, immediately absorbed.

Ohhhhhhhhhhhh,
we stay
limber,
each line
choreographed
from a tremendous mouthful
of swamp, skunk cabbage
              brining at the jowls,
              acquiesced to pestilence,
              and exaggerated diffidence.

Do you know what it is to clamp your shell
              an extra foot into the silt riverbank,
              kissing the soles of passersby,
              silky grains churning the earth over?

Makeshift ceremonial dances,
              fine textiles culled from thrift store bins
              display brightly-colored throats who feed
              stacks of cash killed on recycled names.
There is a golden tapestry
              on the berry-stained
              bottom of Wealth Woman’s
              basket of abalone.
              Beneath it are the exhausted
              faces of her babies
              grown old in the length
              of the inhale, and a facsimile
              remains from all the cycles
              spilled over, since nature
              cannot acid wash, since
              frizz canvassing the ozone
              always carries over.

Geometry for days, countless days,
              spin-cycled through a craftsman’s
              circumpolar hands. There’s always
              another grotto or chamber
              where things dwell, they say.
              Wandering skitterers we are,
              the Northern Lights vacuum pried-open skulls.
                            We cover ourselves with hides and entrails,
                            overripe elderberries, looking to steal a moment
                            of letup from the glare. The limbs of the Old Ones
                            shunt aside bare toes, stripped solid
                            and indifferent as a bear’s den
                            or an ant’s apartment.

Don’t be so much in charge, the frogs say,
              of coalescing wolverine trails
              huddled in 60-million-year pellet tracks
              when the wetlands dried out.

The way soaked, green corpuscles
              rasp each other’s mouths and hands
              braiding the woof of God’s mind,
              that’s how it is, says
              the giant rat’s captive wife.

Even if you can only faintly hear
              the eighth narrative told in the corner
              of the babbling wooden-slat house,
              that is enough leftover hooligan grease
              for the gods with killer whale ganglia.

Knuckles rasp proscenium floorboards,
              splattering herring peck at scops owl’s waist,
              spruce branch
              lowered,
              scrapes conglomerate bedrock.

Mother-in-law’s atonic hands lunge for stewed milt.

One can conclude it’s a virus
              to plant burdensome layers
              of topographic crust on self-renewing
              limbs, like there was more to it
              than rustling fingers at the end of the line.

All components must be in order,
              or it’s an ulcer here, a bladder infection
              there, a baked-out parking lot,
              fizzing in trampled-over, chastened hairlines.

Hold, hold, hold, hold in your palms
              the Steller’s jay that beats its wings
              on glaciers lying high and straight
              over rivers slicing into cool nettles.

Sea lions suck up a quick breath, dive
              and waft on the outskirts of ballerinas
              who gyrate in like-mind
              to classics bubbling up from Sedna’s citadels.

I’m here to show you what you can do
              with this sandbar dialect,
              says the humpback whale
              and the goatsbeard moss, and the ore
              of iron oxide in the shoreline cliff.
You must trust, she says,
                            your swimming blood, joints
                            lumbering in shadows, the dolphin
                            clicking out to you, far above ground.
                            And we should feed just as much as eat,

"Hunters, Gatherers","1

Late fall the white fur grew up your spine
thick as the tail of a marten. You built up the fire,
wrapped your legs with skins, but how that
chill wind broke through sill and jamb.

We stuffed paper in every crevice — an uncle’s will,
the writ that changed your name, a certificate
of Degree of Indian Blood and one that said O positive. Still
we shivered, your eyes yellow in the lantern’s light.

Always, they were out there, in a field of boulders
the size of bears hunched over. O, you were silky
with fur, with a sharp smell I could not get enough of.
I fell into a dream of milk and skin,

on the bed of pelts in the winter cabin. When I woke
they had taken you or you had gone with them.
And didn’t I, so green with sleep, track you
the three days until new snow fell?


2

I packed flint and tinder and a compass
whose face shines in the lowest light.
I learned a song to map the way
and one to call you back.
I crouched over every footprint,
sniffing.
And here
was a broken branch and here
something like hair caught by a bramble.
I followed and followed —
all the yellow hours,
until I came to untouched earth
and waited
in the clearing for the snow to come down
white
as the winter blanket you long had wanted.

In the spring when you
come down hungry from
that other mountain
the space between one rib
and the next deep enough
to lay my finger —
how much of you will
remain or linger —
bone or mouth or memory
of the first sadness of humans?
Will you dig from the crevices
the paper where they
wrote you down as this
instead of that? Or startle
at the clatter of plates?
The creak of the wooden bed?
Will your skin shake off
its fur, your claws remember
they were fingers? And the hands,
meaty as paws, soften into
what I once could stroke or suckle?",Nature
Laughter,"These words of two, three years ago returned.
— Ryūnosuke Akutagawa, tr. by Will Petersen
one day, Coyote sees Duck walking her ducklings,
Coyote asks her how she keeps them in a straight line,
Duck says she sews them together
with white horsetail hair every morning
and tugs on the line gently,
until the horsehair disappears,
that is how she keeps her ducklings in a row

as usual, Coyote leaves smiling, she sees a white horse
grazing in a nearby field,
she plucks a few strands of tail hair
and returns to her burrow

the next morning, one by one
she begins to sew her pups together

when she finishes, she gently tugs on the horsehair
and drags their little bodies along the ground,
Coyote tilts her head in dismay and becomes distraught,
she realizes she has killed her little pups

What Women Are Made Of,"There are many kinds of open.
— Audre Lorde
We are all ventricle, spine, lung, larynx, and gut.
Clavicle and nape, what lies forked in an open palm;

we are follicle and temple. We are ankle, arch,
sole. Pore and rib, pelvis and root

and tongue. We are wishbone and gland and molar
and lobe. We are hippocampus and exposed nerve

and cornea. Areola, pigment, melanin, and nails.
Varicose. Cellulite. Divining rod. Sinew and tissue,

saliva and silt. We are blood and salt, clay and aquifer.
We are breath and flame and stratosphere. Palimpsest

and bibelot and cloisonné fine lines. Marigold, hydrangea,
and dimple. Nightlight, satellite, and stubble. We are

pinnacle, plummet, dark circles, and dark matter.
A constellation of freckles and specters and miracles

and lashes. Both bent and erect, we are all give
and give back. We are volta and girder. Make an incision

in our nectary and Painted Ladies sail forth, riding the back
of a warm wind, plumed with love and things like love.

Crack us down to the marrow, and you may find us full
of cicada husks and sand dollars and salted maple taffy

weary of welding together our daydreams. All sweet tea,
razor blades, carbon, and patchwork quilts of Good God!

and Lord have mercy! Our hands remember how to turn
the earth before we do. Our intestinal fortitude? Cumulonimbus

streaked with saffron light. Our foundation? Not in our limbs
or hips; this comes first as an amen, a hallelujah, a suckling,

swaddled psalm sung at the cosmos’s breast. You want to

The impossible familiar. The somehow known.

On the crowded ferry, cows attempt to drink.

But anyone can see that one scratches her neck,
a good-sailor cow, sickle-hocked, not parched.

Cows like that. Yes. He remembers.

Also that, downriver, float the fishmongers’ baskets
of haddock and crab.

On the way home, this will be also his view,
the river running toward its source, a reverse birthing.

But now, he sees that Rembrandt has wired coils of light
into the shipbuilder’s ruff.

He remembers shipbuilders, the horizon
upon which sailed their fluyts, and above which: homesick.

That was what we call a long time ago
because it has to be called something.

Letter to My Father,"October 2017

You once said: My reward for this life will be a thousand pounds of dirt
shoveled in my face. You were wrong. You are seven pounds of ashes
in a box, a Puerto Rican flag wrapped around you, next to a red brick
from the house in Utuado where you were born, all crammed together
on my bookshelf. You taught me there is no God, no life after this life,
so I know you are not watching me type this letter over my shoulder.

When I was a boy, you were God. I watched from the seventh floor
of the projects as you walked down into the street to stop a public
execution. A big man caught a small man stealing his car, and everyone
in Brooklyn heard the car alarm wail of the condemned: He’s killing me.
At a word from you, the executioner’s hand slipped from the hair
of the thief. The kid was high, was all you said when you came back to us.

When I was a boy, and you were God, we flew to Puerto Rico. You said:
My grandfather was the mayor of Utuado. His name was Buenaventura.
That means good fortune. I believed in your grandfather’s name.
I heard the tree frogs chanting to each other all night. I saw banana
leaf and elephant palm sprouting from the mountain’s belly. I gnawed
the mango’s pit, and the sweet yellow hair stuck between my teeth.
I said to you: You came from another planet. How did you do it?
You said: Every morning, just before I woke up, I saw the mountains.

Every morning, I see the mountains. In Utuado, three sisters,
all in their seventies, all bedridden, all Pentecostales who only left
the house for church, lay sleeping on mattresses spread across the floor
when the hurricane gutted the mountain the way a butcher slices open
a dangled pig, and a rolling wall of mud buried them, leaving the fourth
sister to stagger into the street, screaming like an unheeded prophet
about the end of the world. In Utuado, a man who cultivated a garden
of aguacate and carambola, feeding the avocado and star fruit to his
nieces from New York, saw the trees in his garden beheaded all at once
like the soldiers of a beaten army, and so hanged himself. In Utuado,
a welder and a handyman rigged a pulley with a shopping cart to ferry
rice and beans across the river where the bridge collapsed, witnessed
the cart swaying above so many hands, then raised a sign that told
the helicopters: Campamento los Olvidados: Camp of the Forgotten.

Los olvidados wait seven hours in line for a government meal of Skittles
and Vienna sausage, or a tarp to cover the bones of a house with no roof,
as the fungus grows on their skin from sleeping on mattresses drenched
with the spit of the hurricane. They drink the brown water, waiting
for microscopic monsters in their bellies to visit plagues upon them.
A nurse says: These people are going to have an epidemic. These people
are going to die. The president flips rolls of paper towels to a crowd
at a church in Guaynabo, Zeus lobbing thunderbolts on the locked ward
of his delusions. Down the block, cousin Ricardo, Bernice’s boy, says
that somebody stole his can of diesel. I heard somebody ask you once
what Puerto Rico needed to be free. And you said: Tres pulgadas
de sangre en la calle: Three inches of blood in the street. Now, three
inches of mud flow through the streets of Utuado, and troops patrol
the town, as if guarding the vein of copper in the ground, as if a shovel
digging graves in the backyard might strike the ore below, as if la brigada
swinging machetes to clear the road might remember the last uprising.

I know you are not God. I have the proof: seven pounds of ashes in a box
on my bookshelf. Gods do not die, and yet I want you to be God again.
Stride from the crowd to seize the president’s arm before another roll
of paper towels sails away. Thunder Spanish obscenities in his face.
Banish him to a roofless rainstorm in Utuado, so he unravels, one soaked
sheet after another, till there is nothing left but his cardboard heart.

I promised myself I would stop talking to you, white box of gray grit.
You were deaf even before you died. Hear my promise now: I will take you
to the mountains, where houses lost like ships at sea rise blue and yellow
from the mud. I will open my hands. I will scatter your ashes in Utuado.",Nature

Flight,"It came to pass
that I boarded a plane
and as I edged past the man
in the aisle seat he said
My name is Dov. I knew
you would come.

So Dov came to pass
and then the next thing
came to pass which was
the plane, which fell through the air
so that all felt and understood
the word “slew.”

We held the hands of those
next to us. Dov’s hand. Dov

The hand of my son, who said
Hang on, I’ll just finish listening

we entered the deluge zone

that couldn’t be said out
loud or even in our quiet

We understood
that children sucked life

secretive ways and in silence

We turned away
from the wind bothering the trees,
flaying pansies, knocking lemons
one against another;
away from hymns ancient and
modern, from the holes
dug in the garden for kitchen scraps
that resemble graves
prepared for a succession
of small animals.

Away we turned, back
to a runway on which waited
emergency vehicles

whole, feeling lucky

miles and then another until my chanting made them gasp

The truth about Palmerston North,"People like to mock my town, they mock it
for being too provincial and too boring
and it’s true, not much of import happens here
but I don’t mind. Some people say, when they are asked
what they like about Palmerston North,
that you can always find a park and that’s true,
too, you can always find a park just a short walk
from where you want to go, sometimes right outside,
you don’t have to walk at all, you’re right there.
Of course only people who live in New Zealand
mock Palmerston North, as people who live
outside New Zealand know nothing about it.
People who don’t live in New Zealand mock
our entire little country as a 1950s
throwback with honest, rural folk and unspoilt
scenery which isn’t quite true, our scenery
is spoilt from being looked at too often
and freedom campers, they say, are a problem,
but me, I blame dairy cows. When I lived
in the UK people there thought New Zealand
was a state of Australia, and they would
ask me what was coming up on Neighbours,
thinking I had some kind of inside knowledge,
but the truth is I don’t even watch Neighbours
or indeed any soap operas. Actually
the whole Southern Hemisphere is more or less
written off by people who don’t live here,
as somewhere elsewhere, insignificant,
like Palmerston North, where as I said nothing
much happens. And it’s an undeniable
fact that the magazines I subscribe to
come from exotic places that they flaunt
in their titles, magazines like The New Yorker
and London Review of Books and The Paris Review
but not The Palmerston Northerner.
It’s another fact that The Paris Review
isn’t even published in Paris
and has nothing to say about that city
but it has insightful interviews with famous
writers, some of whom I have read. I have been
to Paris and apart from the architecture
and the food and some very fine cemeteries
and of course the language it’s quite like Palmerston
North, though parking is a nightmare. I never
visited the Louvre but one fine afternoon
I went to the Musée d’Orsay which in the opinion
of many educated people really
is just as good if you like Impressionist
and Post-Impressionist art, which I do.
Still it was nice to come home again, home
to Palmerston North, New Zealand, and to see
the good brown Manawatū River moving
sluggishly under the bridge. It’s not the Seine,
but water is water. Paul Celan threw himself —
odd phrase, as if he were both baseball and pitcher —
into the Seine. John Cleese said Palmerston North
is the suicide capital of New Zealand,
yet you don’t hear of people throwing themselves
into the Manawatū, which would be a risky
business, but only because of the effluent
from those dairy cows leaching into the river.
We live on a floodplain, and the river is ever
in our thoughts and sometimes our houses.
At such times we are downcast but we lift up
our eyes unto the hills and the windmills
perched on them that turn and turn. One time
I saw a middle-aged woman in the Plaza,
our only shopping mall, with her head tilted
to where the sky would have been, but for the ceiling
and the mood lighting, a stout middle-aged woman

her wet mouth a dark, soundless O, and the crowd

Ballad of the Clyde’s Water,"After Lorca
mother’s malison


The burr of the wind is seeping through the door,
pink stumps of rhubarb are breaking through the soil.
Though it is February I have the mind of autumn.
Though it is February    ...

The upstairs baby is crying through the wall,
the bay tree at the window wagging its branches;
huddles of leaves, the wave of a green hand.
It is February.

•

You left your imprint on the bed —
I preserve it, light a candle,
sip saltwater to help my body cry.

I have visions of basking sharks,
great slow-moving shadows,
waning moons for tails —
females — come to birth in the Clyde.

I see babies in the night,
their blue-black eyes barely open,
mouths searching for their mother.

There is no hush where you are
but the endless shudder of waves,
thrum of seal and submarine,
the singing of seaweed
     and algae-wrapped stone.

You will never rest, lie still, water blends
into every part of you, your heart engorged,
brain waterlogged, bones —
a creel for the fish.

•

My William lies dead.
His thick hair floating on the Clyde
is a bouquet of black tulips growing
out of the river.

Who will remember you but the body that birthed you.
Who will remember you but the clouds that swallowed you.
Who will remember you but the moon you threw sticks at.
Who will remember you but your double buried under the apple.

With a torch of burning wood I drain the river.
Who will remember you? Your death is forever.

•

When the time comes
I scratch your name on the back of a stone
and throw it into the Firth.

Because the river is a collector — it gathers relics from the living and the dead.
Because the river carries the elements out to a plastic sea.
Because the river cannot contain the warmth of your rough hands.
Because the river is a hospital corridor, swinging doors without end.

I have seen the rising of the Clyde, waves hurling,
thrashing the road. I have teased them as a girl,
turning as they whip my heels, rain riding my arms.

The Clyde is a dark horse permeating the mind,
carrying off trees, land, the moon,
and my son.

The Firth covered his face, his body sank to the maerl.
But where is he now? — The Kilbrannan Sound.
And now? — The Atlantic.

•

The house is flying around me.

I opened a window and watched him leave.
I ran a bath at the moment of his drowning.

As my body pushed him into this life
so I carried him back over the threshold.

How could I tell him not to go?
How could I tell him I saw it in a dream?

Ally bally, ally bally bee,
sittin’ on yer mammy’s knee



may margaret


He came to the door like a flood,
the waters rising.

I was caught in the tsunami of a dream
when he came to the door;
     my bed riding the waves.

He came while I was sleeping
though my hair sensed he was near.

In the stranglehold of drugged sleep
     he arrived,
but I could not break free.

•

The Clyde came alive under an orchid moon
     like a thousand white snakes
and caught him by the neck.

Thundering in his ears, burning in his lungs.
               He is searching
for a silhouette on the riverbank
     but finds none.
He is searching for the blood-sun,
     break of dawn —
it does not come.

The sky withdraws like a car reversing
down a street, his arms outstretched
     like an act of supplication.

•

I came to the Gantocks to find you, William,
I followed your footsteps in my mind.
I was caught in the red eye of a beacon, William,
I was caught in a double bind.

•

The Firth and sky meet in smoky blue, light cracking the mist,
the tired body of a pier slumped in the water;
my arm burning from your last touch.

At first the Clyde came up to my ankles,
then to my knees, my chin.

Your hat caught in the wild animal
of a piece of driftwood — with tusks,
a wooden tooth, a wooden tongue.

Fragile ripples now roll into nothing.
I watch a gull rising in you.

You had a witch for a mother, William,
I did too.
          So now together we lie
in Clyde’s water
like brother and like sister.

And we shall sleep in Clyde’s water
like sister and like brother.



mother’s deception


Through a closed door I spoke to him.
Through a closed door he thought I was my daughter.
Through a closed door I sent him away,
told him I had another.

•

The arms of the rowan are split,
shooting upwards,
they vibrate in the wind like a tuning fork

releasing pure tones
of sine and cosine — high pitched
like a keening mother.

For whom does she cry?
The berries are her daughters.

Plump, mushy hearts, multiplying —
there are so many of them,
each one star-kissed.

I carried a sprig with me —
bent the twigs into the shape of a cross
and sewed them into the lining of her coat.

The coat they found like a dog
washed up on the beach,
bearing no one.

•

May Margaret, May Margaret,
why did you go?

The waves of the Clyde inhabit you.
I talk to the water, listen

to the drumming of the crab.
I dress a doll in your baby clothes,

white bonnet, mittens —
sit it on my knee.

Brantwood Senilia,"In heaven I mean to go and talk to Pythagoras and Socrates and Valerius Publicola. I shan’t care a bit for Rosie there, she needn’t think it. What will grey eyes and red cheeks be good for there?
— John Ruskin, letter to Susan Beever, from Assisi, Sacristan’s Cell, June 25, 1874
To-day, being my sixty-first birthday, I would ask leave to say a few words to the friends who care for me, and the readers who are anxious about me, touching the above-named illness itself. For a physician’s estimate of it, indeed, I can only refer them to my physicians. But there were some conditions of it which I knew better than they could: namely, first, the precise and sharp distinction between the state of morbid inflammation of brain which gave rise to false visions (whether in sleep, or trance, or waking, in broad daylight, with perfect knowledge of the real things in the room, while yet I saw others that were not there), and the not morbid, however dangerous, states of more or less excited temper, and too much quickened thought, which gradually led up to the illness, accelerating in action during the eight or ten days preceding the actual giving way of the brain.

Too fast and far again! by much; the impetus of phrase running away with me.

            wherein a carriage made of dragon bones

     is depicted making topsy-turvy progress through a jungle
scattering goats & geese & winged skeletal reptiles

  Piazza Sta Maria del Pianto, Rome (1840). A pensive study of old clothes sun-sipped dry in the Jews’ quarter, hanging out of a marble architrave smashed & built into a piece of Roman frieze moldering into broken brickwork projected over wooden windows propped on gray entablature. A vestige of yet-legible inscription: nomine fortuna. No important lines, no beauty of object. A pendent hodgepodge of contrasted feeling cheesecaked into picturesque febrility. An episode. A grief in, as it were, parenthesis. A match without a marriage, as after news of an engagement. A church embedded sans façade among the common sort of houses. A succor from St. Peter’s mere bewilderment & worry. Graphite heightened w/ touches of white body color on gray-green paper.


Beresford Chapel, Walworth: a bare, oblong,
low-ceilinged barn, each brick-arched window filled
with small-paned glass requiring iron bars
threaded like halves of cobweb to stay true.
No traceries, no clustered shafts, no vaulting.
No fantasies. No perpendicular flights
of aspiration. Clean lines, and severe.
Pews shut-in with partitions of plain deal
and neatly brass-hatched doors. No pulpit, merely
a stout, four-legged box of well-grained wainscot,
but decorated with a velvet cushion —
crimson, with golden tassels at the corners —
which formed my one resource, for when I tired
of Dr. Andrews’s sermon I could watch
the colors texturing the folds & creases
each time he thumped it. Beresford. That’s where
we worshipped: Papa, Mama, and I.
Poor preparation, this, for Rouen! Rouen
wardered by groups of solemn statuary
clasped by stems of sculpted leafage crowned
by fretted niche & fairy pediment
like inextricably meshed gossamer;
Rouen with her surge & foam of pious chivalry
breaking on crystal cliffs to stand revealed
as every hidden thing shall be, insatiable at prayer
or pillage, lending grace to English rudeness,
venom to Italy’s cunning    ...    Rouen with all
her avarice & intricacies, gargoyles
open-mawed, molten, drenching ornament
down spires vertiginously pinnacled —
insanae substructiones! Inutiles domos! —
yet piping pastoral songs of innocence —

  The Palazzo Contarini-Fasan, Venice (1841). Higgledy terraced structures the colors of ice creams & sorbets w/ no bland tinting. No calligraphic decoration. Graphite, watercolor & body color. A thorough spell in the vernacular. Stone filigree spidering rhythmic tessellations w/ some scratching out. Details that become a refuge. Detail that becomes a refuge. A long-drawn replica in which new life may even now be in the offing. A sulky grandeur, by the bye. A naughty jailer. A determined postulant. A barber-pole mooring post. A dipped oar tilting  for trouble. The Doge’s tottering state stepping off on gray paper.


Worn somewhat, and not a little weary,
Sandro’s uncommon Fortitude, in this
his first recorded work. Consider it
a moment, if you please, before you pass
hurriedly on to see The Birth of  Venus
next door, and notice that Sandro began
where you perhaps will end: with weariness.
Would you have guessed that Fortitude allows
(allows? approves of!) reverie? See how
her fingers play in restless idleness
or nervousness about her sword hilt
(sword or mace? I’ve lost my notes about her    ...    ).
She is no match, it may be, for the trials
that are to come, yet see her armor shine
in readiness, her gentle fingers apt
to grip her sword (or mace) should she be called.
Lips pursed and eyes averted, she has smiled,
and not a little ruefully, at her fate
from time to time. She has no smile today.
Her quality must be borne daylong, lifelong.
To flaunt it ever is not to possess
it quite. See Pollaiolo’s Virtues pose
and attitudinize: thus they perform
their various meanings. Fortitude must
contain — must be — all that she stands for. Go,
see whatever the Uffizi has
to tempt you; but remember Fortitude
whose battle did not begin today,
nor yesterday, nor on the Sunday last.
Many a day has passed since it began.
They are so wedded to their righteousness,
those lesser Virtues, quite incapable
of  being tempted. They would not dare risk
complacency. She would be lost without it.
But sword or mace? Go now. It is no matter.
I will not need you until tomorrow morning.

  Ravine at Maglans (1849?). Deeper brown on brown. A limestone precipice stepped with horizontal cleavages to overlook the void. No water but a dream of water years back, far down, running harum-scarum strong enough to turn a mill. A spate become a thread. A visit out of season. A torrent bed of what must have been snow-melt now entirely dry. No stones crumble but flow, subside, rhythmic as cloud, as high-built, as unsubstantial over the long haul. Quartz strips ribboning a treed crevasse fringed w/ curled & unfurled fronds. Leaves shook to palsy by the noon wind’s spite. A rock fissured. A great fault. A graphite rock fissured in brown ink & ink wash heightened w/ flesh-toned body color on white paper.


Last night St. Ursula sent me her dianthus
out of her bedroom window, with her love —
living dianthus, and a single dried
sprig of  her other window flower, vervain    ...
how many flowers are named in Genesis?
Good answer! Not one. Plenty of trees, however.
It was a poet planted flowerbeds
that Eden might be filled with tremulous,
frivolous petals — I dare say he was right,
they were made to be noticed! And to see
a poppy husk fall from a bursting flower
is to know something of the life to come
once the body has turned to dust & ashes,
even as our dying breath aspires
toward our Father’s house    ...    as for the trees,
what can we learn of noble constancy
more than we find in the pure laurel leaf,
so numerable, so sequent and serene?
  open the envelope
petals & may
spill on the table
where I remain
preparing the lesson
  bruise-edged rose petals
cling to my fingers
dust motes dancing
gnats in a sun-shaft
myrrh, or a snuffbox?
  write to me, tell me
who do you dance with
oftenest, often?
gray eyes & red cheeks
useless in heaven
  undowered, garlanded
with no forget-me-nots:
compassed about
with the forgetfulness
of all the world
  honor unwon
kind words unsaid
good deeds undone:
none of these, none
touch me more nearly

Now, if  I say “St. Ursula has sent me
a pot of pinks!” some will say I have gone
heartily, headily mad, but all it means
is that the flowers I received of  late
(from the hand of whatsoever friend or stranger)
helped greatly in my work, and afterward
reproved me in their own way for its failure.
But how much love of mine have others lost
because one poor sick child would not receive
the part of love that yet belongs to her!
Think now, sweet milkmaids of Albion
whose face is your fortune, think of one
lying still there, nearly a skeleton,
and ask yourselves: We have a little sister
and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister
in the day of  her espousals?

  South Side of the Basilica of St. Mark’s, Venice, from the Loggia of the Ducal Palace (c.1851). An eerie vantage. A capricious helter-skelter variety of application, quickening details of watercolor passing  for time-veined marble scaled-up from a daguerreotype. An echo’s volume. Shadows lilt & flourish over chessboard floor tiles. A kind of hectic color. Disallowance of perspective. Sculpted relief without recession. Megrims & mysteries; conceits & divertisements. The uncapped St. Jean d’Acre’s pillar giving on to the southern portico. A Byzantine capital. A sonata on a virginal. Graphite & watercolor heightened w/ white on three jointed pieces of paper.


           Up my spirit leapt, so glad
           to shed this gross flesh and have done!
           My ghost, given up by the grace of God,
           was led where marvels are counted common.
           I climbed to where cliff-top meets cloud —
           vertiginous heights no man has known —
           my soul drawn on toward a wood
           decked with countless jewels & stones.
           It is hard to credit a sight so fine
           as the wash of  light in which they shone:
           woman never wove a gown
           so dearly adorned, so lit with splendor.

           In splendor, cliffs of crystal stood
           crisp as ice, clear & clean.
           At their foot, a forest spread:
           the trees were touched with a red-blue sheen
           and leaves of  burnished silver slid
           quivering to & fro between
           limbs that shimmered like blue jade
           each time a light-gleam touched the scene.
           The gravel underfoot was strewn
           with gems, and the sun seemed quite outshone
           by those precious, oriental stones
           so dearly adorned, so lit with splendor.

           The splendor of the grove was such
           that my grief left me — it lifted clear;
           the fragrance of the fruit so fresh,
           I found I needed no other fare.
           Birds flew together, branch to branch
           like flecks of flame — now here now there;
           no human symphony can match,
           nor voice nor string delight the ear
           with such a song: they blessed the air
           with a sweet accord that swooned & shone
           with harmonies you will never hear
           but there where all is lit with splendor.

           So adorned in splendor was
           that forest where I met my fate,
           a cunning man could not devise
           a fitting way to tell of it.
           Climbing pear trees, apple trees;
           browsing wonders — pretty sport!
           And soon the flowers & fields & hedgerows
           turned beautifully intricate
           with burns & water gardens. Bright
           as burnished gold the fellside shone
           where I trailed a stream that ran with light,
           dearly adorned & lit with splendor.

           But a greater splendor was yet to come:
           a riverbank of  beryl ablaze
           where water swept & swirled in a foam
           of  hurrying murmurs & confused airs.
           The stream bed glinted with a gleam
           like sunlight filtered through stained glass
           or winter starlight, when it may seem
           we’re all alone when the clouds pass.
           Each pebble bright as Hesperus:
           sapphire, emerald — each one shone
           with a light too bright for similes,
           dearly adorned & lit with splendor.

  Study of Gneiss Rock, Glenfinlas (1853–54). A living witness. A verticality more smooth than the water over wch it rears. Glib-channeled water rushing; dry rock dripping — fluid, labial rock, less still than the wildflowers & feathered grasses that cling in unguessed cracks & overhang. Mapped lichens. Lampblack, body color. A cumbrous slab. An unobtrusive majesty. A happenstance long sought before seen, loved long before understood. A lesson of devotion to be found always, found but once. An obstinacy gladdened by the river’s flux, the ice floe’s pluck & laving. Pen & ink over graphite on wove paper w/ some scratching out.


In Santa Croce, here we are
well quit of restoration, for who cares
about this slab with its poor bit of sculpture?
An old man in the deeply-folded cap
worn by the scholars & gentlemen of  Florence
c.1300–1500, dead,
a book upon his breast, and over it
his hands lie folded. At his feet, the legend:

The worn face, still the old man’s perfect portrait —
though one struck out by a master’s chisel
at a venture, just so, with a few rough touches;
the falling drapery of  his citizen’s cap
subtle beyond description, with the choice of folds
exquisite in its ornamental pattern;
the carpet he lies on almost uninjured,
elaborate with fringe & frond
relieving the severity of the figure    ...
and see now, see how the cushion’s nearly-perfect tassels
balance to fill the angles of the stone —

  Study of a Peacock’s Breast Feather (1873). A single plume, painted of its natural size. One iridescent throb transitioning from the active plume’s obliquity to the decorative’s dualed symmetry. An uncertain correspondence w/ a heart-shaped flower petal. A cold thrill: a pang as of a nice deep wasp sting. Moss green moving via jade to emerald, indigo to lapis lazuli: as much as is allowed, having neither hocus-pocus nor heaven to dip a brush in. A heraldic emblem; watch & ward against incipient commodity. A lost key to a blue box for blue girls w/ gray eyes. Watercolor & body color on paper.

The Calm,"At the mouth of the river,
Moon, stars, an Arctic calm,
The twin lights at the end of the piers
Revolving with the smoothness
We expect of supernatural machinery.

Seen from down here on the beach
The harbored ocean slowly tilts,
Like a mirror discreetly manhandled
By night from the giant room
It was supposed to occupy forever.

The mind says now, but the stars
On their angelic gimbals roll
And fade, a tide of constellations
Breaking nowhere, every night
About this time. Strike up the band.

In the tumbledown bar, the singer
Has fallen from stardom and grace,
But though her interests nowadays
Are wholly secular, she can
Still refer back to the angels,

And knowing that song, we share
A moment with the saved before
We leave to make the crossing.

Cross we shall, believe you me.",Nature

i. troppo allegro


Remember seasons? Seem to recall those once were easier.
Reasonably sequenced, regal of tempo and temper,
Reliable change flipped heads-over-tails each quarter,
Recovering the hemisphere with four fine suits, knock-off designer.

Recently, someone shuffled, cut the deck into disorder:
Relapse, tic, hiccup, snap, weeks reissued like hipster
Rediscoveries    ...    join the club! No closer
Reading required to diagnose this crazy weather:

Record highs, flourishing lows. April even crueler
Recapitulated each fortnight. Spring hailing like a howitzer.
Reek of summer tickling autumn’s automatic sprinkler.
Redder-neck sunbathers burnt by November’s toaster. A warbler

Retweeting Keats, well into winter. A death for Easter.



ii. funeral: march


Remember: misremembering that fishy Faulkner

Remark, the dead are never passed. Ask: will this chapter
Retain familiar cycles? Lather, rinse, repeat. Swelter,

Reins, release. Welter, ruins, reseed. Seconds per

Revolution: top-heavy spinning, simian moods over-
Reaching from swing to swing. For reveler,

Read revelator: elevator going upper, downer,

Results of a heart dialed three degrees warmer.
Remedial Ecclesiastes: a time for X, and a-whole-nother

Reciprocal time for X’s refrain, a dinner

Reservation for six — make that five — and an altogether
Regrettable time for the long and short divisions of disaster.

Remainder: only a matter of time. No more time to matter.

"Tobacco Origin Story, Because Tobacco Was a Gift Intended to Walk Alongside Us to the Stars","From a story of how the tobacco plant came to our people, told to me by my cousin George Coser Jr.
It was way back, before there was a way back
When time threaded earth and sky.
Children were conceived, were born, grew, and walked tall
In what we now call a day.
There must have been two suns, a bright moon, somehow
We had more light than now, sheen
Of falling in love playing about Earth’s body
In a wild flicker which lit
Us up. We who were this planet and yearned for touch.
Every planted thought grew plant
Ladders to the stars, way back, before there was
No way back, Miss Mary Mack.
We used to sing along the buttons of her
Dress. Our babies are always
Our babies. Even back then when time waved through
The corn. We knew our plants like
Relatives. Their stories were our stories, there
Were songs for everything — I
Should say “are” songs for every transformation
They link between way back and
Now, the forever now, a time when a young
Mvskoke man and woman
Walked through the shimmer of the early evening.
They had become as one song.
They lay down when it was dark. I can hear their
Intimate low-voice talking.
How they tease one another with such gut love.
Earth makes a bed, with pillow
Mounds. And it is there as the night insects sing
They conceived their first child. They
Will look back as they walk East toward the sunrise.
The raw stalks of beginning

The plant-child emerges, first the seed head, then
Leafy, long male body and the white female
Flowers of tobacco, or
Hece, as the people called it when it called
To them. Come here. We were brought
To you from those who love you. We will help you.
And that’s how it began, way
Back, when we knew how to hear the songs of plants
And could sing back, like now
On paper, with marks like bird feet, but where are
Our ears? They have grown to fit
Around earbuds, to hear music made for cold
Cash, like our beloved smoke-
Making threaded with addiction and dead words.
Sing this song back to me, girl.
In the moonlight, tobacco plant had silver
Moon buttons all up her back.
We’re getting dressed to go plant new songs with words.
Our sun is dimming faster.

The gray-green Rhône

And log jams waiting for transport,
Like the island exporting itself to its neighbors one barge at a time.

The river, the road, and the railway,
A plait, a tangle, a place of through.
The river not navigable, the boggy valley floor not walkable,
The locals came down from the mountains a little way
To site castles on moraine and regulate trade.

Poplars were planted en passant by Napoleon’s Grande Armée

Driving to Santa Fe,"Quick swim up through my headlights: gold eye

raking mine. A full second

Gone. And how did I know
what to call it? Lynx, the only possible

filling with it: moonlight,
piñon: a cat’s acrid smell
of terror. How quickly the gray body
fled, swerving to avoid
my light. And how often
that sight returns to me, shames me
to know how much more this fragment
matters. More than the broad back
of a man I loved. More than the image
of my friend, cancer-struck, curled
by her toilet. More than my regret
for the child I did not have which I thought
once would pierce me, utterly. Nothing
beside that dense muscle, faint gold guard hairs
stirring the dark. And if I keep
these scraps of it, what did it keep of me?
A flight, a thunder. A shield of light
dropped before the eyes, pinned
inside that magnificent skull only time
would release. Split back, fade
and reveal. Wind
would open him. Sun would turn him
commonplace: a knot of flies, a rib cage
of shredded tendon, wasp-nest
fragile. The treasure of him, like anything,
gone. Even now, I thumb that face

I lived in him, fishing the cold
trout-thick streams, waking to snow, dying
when he died, which is a comfort.

I Am Chito,"The first time I ever heard about coyotes
Was in a book called (in Japanese) Seton’s Animals for Boys and Girls
There I encountered Lobo the Wolf King, bighorn sheep, a family of wild boars, cottontail rabbits, and raccoons, but it was the stories of the wise coyote I loved the best
I read the book over and over, over and over, it taught me the wisdom of rabbits, wolves, wild boars, but nothing surpassed the wisdom of the coyote
Tito was raised by humans, was kept constantly on a leash
No one loved her, they teased her until she ran away
She learned to survive
Ran for her life with her pups in her mouth
Trying to get away from dogs and people
I read about her over and over, over and over
There was a map of America in the front of the book with pictures of animals where the stories took place: coyotes in the central plains, wolves in the southwest and north, elsewhere there were cottontails, boars, and partridges
During my childhood, that was America to me
Where did that book go? I no longer live in my childhood home, not even in the same town, not even in the same country, I lost my place there, I lost people and relationships, almost lost others too, I lost my language, but what about that book I read over and over, over and over? I must have lost it too

Just the other day
I tried searching for it on Amazon
It popped right up, and I ordered it straight away
Lives of the Hunted it’s called in English
Published in 1901, reprinted in 1967
It arrived at my home
A former library copy, the word discard stamped on it in big letters, probably the library didn’t want it because the stories are too cruel, too cruel for today’s youth, nowadays kids are used to killing one another in the virtual world, but even so, the stories are too cruel, a mother coyote was giving her cubs her milk, was licking them when hunters shot her dead, her cubs fled into their den, only to be dragged out one by one
Here is how the book describes it:
Even at this age there was a certain individuality of character among the puppies. Some of them squealed and some of them growled when dragged out to die. One or two tried to bite. The one that had been slowest to comprehend the danger, had been the last to retreat, and so was on top of the pile, and therefore the first killed. The one that had first realized the peril had retreated first, and now crouched at the bottom of the pile. Coolly and remorselessly the others were killed one by one, and then this prudent little puppy was seen to be the last of the family. It lay perfectly still, even when touched, its eyes being half closed, as, guided by instinct, it tried to “play possum.” One of the men picked it up. It neither squealed nor resisted.
Neither squealed
Nor resisted ...
The book was in English, but I could read it quickly
Since I remembered the Japanese
I had read the book over and over, over and over
All the coyote pups were killed
Only one survived, only a single pup
Tossed with its dead littermates into a sack and taken to a farm
In the original, the hunters named her Tito
That’s what I had suspected, I had read it in an old translation, kids in Japan back then couldn’t be expected to pronounce the unfamiliar sound ti, but that’s the version I was brought up on
So for me, her name was always Chito
I was always Chito

Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-w-o-o-o-o-o-o-w
I remember her voice
When I was a child, I read the book over and over, over and over
Here is how the book describes it:
an inborn hankering to sing
Her songs were
a volley of short barks
mixed with doleful squalls —
Wow-wow-wow-wow-wow-w-o-o-o-o-o-o-w
Here is how the book describes it:
when the sun went down she would feel the impulse to sing that wild song of the West which means so much to the Coyotes. It is not the invention of an individual nor of the present, but was slowly built out of the feelings of all Coyotes in all ages.
I’m not sure if I remember the Japanese correctly
Getting old is no fun at all, you forget important things like that
It is not the invention of an individual nor of the present,
but was slowly built out of the feelings of all Coyotes in all ages and
Her experiences all emphasized for her that old idea to “lay low”—
that is, to be quiet, unobtrusive, and hide when danger is in sight
Those were the most important things I learned as a child
Chito’s wisdom
How to survive
Seeing the book, I remembered why
I came to this place called America
The most important things I learned as a child
Were in that book I read over and over
Maybe I had lost them for a while
Or just forgotten
The fate of the animals, their lives and deaths
Their lives upon the plains, and my life too
Chito was killed over and over again
But each time she came back to life
The humans tenaciously, persistently killed her
She tricked them and was tricked by them in return
She scattered her feces, went into heat
The more they hunted her
The more clearly things came into focus
In other words, all the things she thought along the way
Not the invention of an individual nor of the present
But slowly built out of the feelings of all coyotes in all ages
It was for Chito
For Chito
That I abandoned my home, bought an airline ticket
And came to this place
There was someone I barely knew, I’d only barely caught his scent
But still I followed my nose and pursued him
I found a room, rented a car
And stayed the full three months permitted without a visa, I thought I’d try to stay
When people asked me why I’d come, I said
I’m a poet, I’ve come to learn about the oral traditions of the Native Americans
And that was true
But I didn’t even know what I wanted to know
I didn’t know where to go
I didn’t know whom to ask
I was terrible at speaking with people in my native tongue, so in English it was damn near impossible, I couldn’t even tell them who I am (it took me decades to say that even in Japanese)
But the real reason I came
Was because I wanted to encounter a coyote
I wanted to prick up my ears and listen to its howl
Rattling dryly over the roads, through the darkness of night

furtive routes. Expect to hear a lot
about erotic consummation inferred
by laburnum gyrations and bamboo
syncopations. Listen to the racket
of wide-mouthed frogs and bent-
legged prawns going about their
business of mating while rain falls
and falls on tiled roofs and verandas,
courtyards, pagodas. Because such
a big part of you seeks to understand
this kind of rain — so unlike your cold
rain, austere rain, get-me-the-hell-
out-of-here rain. Rain that can’t fathom
how to liberate camphor from the vaults
of the earth. Let me tell you how little
is written of mud, how it sneaks up
like a sleek-gilled vandal to catch hold
of your ankles. Or about the restorative
properties of mosquito blood, dappled
and fried against the wires of a bug-zapping
paddle. So much of monsoon is to do
with being overcome — not from longing
as you might think, but from the sky’s
steady bludgeoning, until every leaf
on every unremembered tree gleams

Come. Now sip on your masala tea,
put your lips to the sweet, spicy skin

the dogs who’ve been fucking on the beach,
locked in embrace like an elongated Anubis,
the crabs scavenging the flesh of a dopey-
eyed ponyfish, the entire delirious coast
with its philtra of beach and saturnine
clouds arched backwards in disbelief.
And the mayflies who swarm in November
with all their ephemeral grandeur to die
in millions at the behest of light, the geckos
stationed on living room walls, cramming
fistfuls of wings in their maws. Notice
how hardly anyone mentions the word
death, even though the fridge leaks
and the sheets have been damp for weeks.
And in this helter-skelter multitude
of gray-greenness, notice how even the rain
begins to feel fatigued. The roads and sewers
have nowhere to go, and like old-fashioned pursuers
they wander and spill their babbling hearts
to electrical poles and creatures with ears.
And what happens later, you might ask,
after we’ve moved to a place of shelter,
when the cracks in the earth have reappeared?
We dream of wet, of course, of being submerged
in millet stalks, of webbed toes and stalled
clocks and eels in the mouth of a heron.

led us to believe that men were mountains,
that the beautiful could never remain

The New Boy 2,"1


You may find at the market a casual comment swerves into conversation that’s deeply metaphysical with a young man by produce.

He wears a white T and jeans, ordinary yet careful about his food.

“Every time I meditate, I begin in space among the stars,” he says.

“Many of these beings,” he continues, “are not physically 3-D, so it’s frustrating to describe them.”

“I have the impression their silver color comes from within.”

“They look at me with tremendous love from almond-shaped eyes.”

“There’s no sunlight. The whole cloud structure is luminous and the ground crystalline.”

“A lot of purple and blue, like twilight.”

It’s a complex, partly inarticulate narrative, perhaps because he feels I won’t believe him, yet he’s spontaneous.

I don’t need to question the reality of his story.

He’s sincere.

I like that he expresses himself to me as a kind of witness in transition.

He’s read my work, and thinks me more knowledgeable than I am, since my poems aren’t true.

“Pleiadians create new visuals through which I can imagine,” he says.

My care is required for witness to resonate energetically with listener, however nonchalant I appear.

The more compassion one has for non-normal experiences of others, the sooner consciousness will shift toward the stars.

To him, this means shifting the ethical structure of communicating a narrative.

“I think of myself in a service capacity.”

“One silvery insect was seven feet tall; I shook his claw and we conversed.”

“Sometimes reptiles hoard crystals to send and receive information.”

“They can space-travel versions of themselves here, as snakes.”

“Lipids in a membrane behave like that, channeling the atmosphere.”

At home I write, “The membrane is like a liquid crystal to the sky.”

Next week, in line, he’s with a beautiful woman with a worn face who knows me.

She’s not well, and she wants me to visit them and their animals.

“They know they don’t end when they die,” she says; “It’s sad they’re leaving, but it’s voluntary.”

“They’ve relatives on other planets, sentient beings with the right to vote.”

“Have you ever watched an animal and suddenly it disappears?” he chips in.

Witness involves a significance equivalent to truth.

“The whole idea of visiting another planet, communicating with a being from another world, to me that’s spiritual.”

“When they speak, they subtly vary certain sounds; I hear words, but their sound carries different meaning to my body.”

“Some words I read weren’t there when I began.”

I can carry more light, which fuses with similar energies in mass consciousness.

Earth will radiate this consciousness as a star or sun on horizons of his other worlds.

“Let us hold that portal open for you, in the form of your little crush on him, of light streaming down, and feel a surrounding new ideal,” they say to me.

“Now, imagine yourself in the Pleiades.”

Snow in the Morning,"The couple is traveling up the mountain.
They have been traveling a long time to get to the mountain.
They left early with their son who strums
sweet songs with his fingers,
songs his mother sang when she was young,
singing sweetly like him for all that was yet to come.

In the morning they saw snow on the mountain,
waking as if to another country,
far away from rain on the island of orchids
where smoke is indistinguishable from mist, rain from stone.
They wanted to get there before the snow melted,
before it vanished like a memory.

They left early, leaving the house they had built
in the forest, the house that had aged with them,
skin as dry as the logs they threw into evening fires.
Before the son could talk, he walked among the trees,
dreamed where roots lifted as if to let the earth breathe,
resting to the sounds of his parents pulling, clearing, dragging,
the sounds he later understood as what needs tending.

The boy would climb the ladder to the loft,
survey the trees and, peering through a curtain of leaves,
proclaim himself ruler of all that he saw.
His mother and father moved in and out of the mist,
lumpy shadows lifting rocks, carrying water, planting
heart-shaped flowers, speaking wordlessly to each other.

The boy is alone in the back seat as they drive past
the tin-roofed town, the market where under blue waves of tarp
orchids spray out of buckets,
bananas hang like tropical chandeliers,
coffee beans slide down waxy pyramids
and vendors fan at the jeweled flies,
keeping fish on ice.

His fingers pluck single notes,
random at first and then combined
as if his fingers could find a way to string
his thoughts the way the road progressed
past the last house, the last fern, the last
tree sparkling fireworks of red blossoms.

racing to unload the precious cargo

as he climbs the slopes into clouds.
It is all confusion — a whiteout he must negotiate,
the puny engine unsuitable for the elevation, the dangerous road conditions.

a cloud’s rolled tongue, wet and pregnant

What to Read This Summer,"Terrible are the rose names ...
Stakeholders in a tradition of
“Grande Amore” and “True Love”
(one carmine, the other blush ... ), their aims

are, for the most part, scattershot.
“Mothersday” and “Playboy,”
“Senior Prom” and “Let’s Enjoy”
vie with a lyrical “Lady of Shalott,”

while a flyweight “Pink Knockout”
comes “Outta the Blue” to mock
“Honey Perfume,” “Pillow Talk”
— jock Cupid wielding clout.

Then maybe a puckish curator
pairs “Las Vegas” with “Nearly Wild,”
“Buttercream” with “Julia Child,”
“Aloha” with “Hello, Neighbor ... ”

to practice trumpet on this platform,

what with the dentistry squeal
at construction site decibel levels
of braking blade shaving molar steel,

dropped-in blare of delays and arrivals
squelched against granite, at close intervals,
while you riff on “Over the Rainbow” — ?

You received some negative attention
from Triton, after blowing his conch so loud

in an unwinnable contest; now,
stuck in a twenty-first-century translation
of hell, you press the stops, and for an obol

An Anthology of Rain,"For this you may see no need,
You may think my aim
Dead set on something

Devoid of conceivable value:
An Anthology of  Rain,
A collection of voices

Telling someone somewhere
What it means to follow a drop
Traveling to its final place of rest.

But do consider this request
If you have pressed your nose
Of any shape against a window,

Odor of metal faint, persistent,
While a storm cast its cloak
Over the shoulder of every cloud

In sight. You are free to say
Whatever crosses your mind
When you look at the face of time

In the passing of one drop
Gathering speed, one drop
Chasing another, racing to reach

A fork in the path, lingering
Before making a detour to join
Another, fattening on the way

Until entering a rivulet
Running to the sill.
So please accept this invitation:

You are welcome to submit,
There is no limit to its limit,
Even the instructions are a breeze

As long as you include
Nothing about yourself
Except your name. Your address

Remains unnecessary, for the rain
Will find you — if you receive it
It receives you (whether or not

You contribute, a volume
Is sent). And when you lift
The collection you may hear,

By opening anywhere, a drop
And its story reappear

"David Ignatow, 1914–1997","        I am as guilty as many. No one speaks of David Ignatow anymore.
No one speaks of  your lonesome time in the New York boonies,

No one speaks of your sparsely furnished rooms,
the low-slung Danish sofa where you sit and muse and daydream

An uncertain world of make-believe made more believable, I wanna say.

backyard song,"Since it’s just me here I’ve
found the back and stayed
there most of the time, in
rain and snow and the
no-moon nights, dodging the front
I used to put up like a yard
gussied and groomed, all
edged and flower-lined, my
bottled life.
Uncorked, I had a thought: I
want the want
I dreamed of wanting once, a
quarter cup of sneak-peek
at what prowls in the back, at
what sings in the
wet rag space behind the garage, back

where the rabbits nest, where
I smell something soupish, sour and dank and it’s
filled with weeds like rough
cat tongues and
the wind is unfostered, untended,
now that it’s just me here and
I am so hungry
for the song that grows tall like a weed
grows, and grows.

Ecological Poem,"Around the pool the hippos drool
as if the chloride wouldn’t kill them.
In fact, they like to play the fool,

The bird that plops into the glass

Spiders toss, in oleaginous mass,
Goo Gone into the air.

The ants that drag a beat-up car
onto the lawn are emissaries
of some forgotten prince or tsar
from an HBO miniseries.

The cheetah, panther, jaguar, and lynx
(some of these might be the same)
conjure images of Sphinx
and other trademarked names.

The dynamited hole now teems
with insects shiny and obscene,
crawling, dying, though it dreams
an ectoplasm of green.

My own two cats stiffen, confused
at this profusion past the door.
They bat at things they’ve often used
for sound therapy before.

I tell you this out of principle:
that spiraling around a theme

can supercharge a meme.

The Explorer,"I lied when Pops asked, but I’ll admit it now. I did touch the blue egg to see if, somehow,
it felt as much like the sky as it looked. The egg: speckled in its twiggy nest, eye level to
8-year-olds, perfect & off-limits like the Baoding balls on Pops’ desk. We tried to find
its mom, but the finches scattered when we came near. One twittered the alarm from a
maple. Others balanced on wires, flapped wings at us like we were gravity. I can still
see how carefully Garrett scooped the egg from the nest, then headed out to find a spot
on the March concrete to drop it. I want to see if these things break into pieces or in
half like on TV. Always the follower, I followed him through the maples out into the
treeless street, my stomach dropping before the egg did. A crunch, then no more noise.",Nature

Feeling blue for identifying some people who don’t respect you

Le Tombeau des Lutteurs,"It is a tragedy, yes, but a confusing one. What happened to the wrestlers and where have they gone? Loulou the Pomeranian would love to know. Outdoors the hills are buried in snow, but inside a rose, a rose full-blown, a roomful of rose. The bloom and its shadow overtaking the space. The bloom proposing an impossible tomb. Of the Tachists, the master said to his friend Harry, “They paint white on white, and they believe that this is an achievement.” Harry said, “I dare you to paint a white rose in a white room with a window looking onto a landscape covered with snow.” Now this — which even Loulou, color-blindish, can tell is red — is the master’s grandiose response to an intoxicating challenge. Synesthetically, the rose fills Loulou’s pom ears with the echoes of torch songs, longing for the wrong. Loulou is practically drunk from the smell: a heady pink, and juicy, and almost obscene. Like crushed up candies, lingering and sweet, but with an adult musk at the core: a powerful flower. In looking, Loulou’s heart becomes a house at dusk about to force something to happen.",Nature
A Parable of Sorts,"We danced to rancorous tunes on spiked ground and

gyrated to blowed trumpets and cradled songs, but,
us black rats with our rogue swagger that spoke

of foreign ports, pranced our survival shuffle in
night’s murky dance halls. Each step our single

prayer, each jab our benediction. This tart sermon

She Spent a Year Hallucinating Birds,"They perched on roofs and fences and sills. They posed statue-still on catenary lines. They aligned along cables like prayer beads on rope. They amassed en masse on the cemetery lawn and marauded the broad, yawning fields like cattle. Their cackles were black. Each shadow dove and pecked. They nested in chimneys and chirped at the chime of the church bell. They worked in shifts. Clocked out at odd hours. They laid their eggs in the Vs of trees. They teemed on the dry-baked banks of creek beds, streams the sun had overseen. They teetered on the bed-knob tops of flagpoles. They pitched like pennies into founts. They pitched like babies into wells. They thumped at doors then skulked away like hoodlum teens. They jabbed her. When she cried they did it faster. Everyone knows what happened next. Some grew big as sunflower stalks, others tall like bonfire flames. Or moving vans. Or the sick, brick houses people die inside of every night. Their hatchlings canopied the sky. Was it her fault, then, when they pinned her to the ground and thrust their feathers down her throat? Or wormed between her legs in bad-man ways? Or rattled plumes and whooped and beat her body with their wings? Or locked their talons to her thighs and tra-la-la-ed that ditty from the old-time music box? Or forced their whiskies past her lips? Or put her in the pillory? This was foreplay, in a way. They rolled in rabid packs and woofed like dogs. She couldn’t throw a bone. The meat was gone. They chased her and they named her and they boiled her tears and bathed her. Then they ate her.",Nature

  Two large cormorants flew rapidly and very low across the water heading directly towards Langstone Rock, where Dawlish Warren joins the coast just beyond the western edge of the Exe estuary. Their wing tips were almost touching the choppy water. This must have been about 7:45 on Friday morning; I was thirty yards or so out in the sea, only my head visible between the waves that the cormorants flew in among as they powered along one behind the other. I had come down the concrete lifeboat ramp and taken just a few steps on wet sand scattered with various shells, little gleaming stones, and scraps of seaweed, getting quickly into the cool water. The sky was piled up with dark gray cloud overhead but clear and bright at the horizon. The two birds passed close by and continued on their way indifferent to me watching them from the water and they gave no indication if they saw anything unusual.

The Glens of Cithaeron,"Till the gold fields of stiff wheat
Cry “We are ripe, reap us!”
—Ted Hughes
I begin to think Actaeon never changed.
The words that followed him, the poems
That leapt upon him and left him for dead
Were difficult exactly to the extent
They were rational. It makes perfect sense
For nakedness to give way to frenzy.
And the poems, let’s be clear, were naked.

Time was, questions were put, clear as water.
The Goddess bathed, and time was the soft smile
Of water catching the sunlight on her.
And the sunlight, let’s be clear, was sheer murder.
Into the same creature, no human word
Leaps twice. Given to frenzy, nakedness
Smiles upon the breaking of men and dogs.

How easy to lose all patience with chaste things!
Christ, I am hoping to hear from you
Before the hunters and suicides make off with me.
Christ, I am hoping to take your weapons
To a tarn freezing in the death of me.
I shall harry the moon there. I shall halloo.
Bayed in the cross-tree is a lion too.

In 1969 a red stag made
A cobweb of moonlight in his antlers.
For once in your life, pray without ceasing,
Pray the stag safely by the lion’s tree.
Actaeon never changed. Predator
Is simply prey to nakedness and reason.
The poems have been out hunting all the time.

Then it is Friday. Frisk. You might as well.
Seeing as the rapeweed, you might as well.
The lion is no stranger. The belling
Stag is as familiar as the moon, but a strange
Suicide. Taken by legs, taken
By sinews, kissing the cobwebs of moonlight,
He prays the prayer I was not quick to say.

Berries and hoardings, ermine horseplay short
Of the new, short of poems no longer old
As I knew them, leaving the small schools
For the main campus rapeweed climbing, pale.
It is Friday. Stars won’t cross. Actaeon
Never imagined the frail, sheer speed
Of meat. Christ, eat me. Nothing else makes sense.

On the far
Safe side of becoming,
Metaphor

Is all love,
The pure being of each
Nude above

Perfect sense.
I begin to hunt words.
The tension

The soft smile
Of the Goddess eases
A short while

Reappears
In a red stag’s terror.
Metaphor

Leaps and eats.
It is not difficult.
Love is meat.

The dogs leap on Actaeon. He is human.
I begin to think of Time as anything
In the gift of humans or as sacrifice
To the long uplift of lions in the blood.
Now dogs tear deeply into the living flesh.
Each moment is a visible agony,
And still the godly human nature remains

Unharmed. I never imagined the sheer frail
Of fear so powerful. Legs and sinews turn
Into flowers. Between her breasts, the Goddess
Shelters one such, one blood violet alive.
The porch of heaven is littered with color.
As familiar as the moon, our humanness
Crosses into heaven as the new poem.

On the far side of becoming, a life’s work
Begins another kind of work, but naked
Of change. There are animals, water and trees.
Nothing is recognizable in its old
Skin, yet everything shimmers. I am afraid,
Shrinking from the teeth of the cold water
And from the howling trees. I perish at this point

Down among dogs and upwards beside lion.
The pieces of me are carried fast away
By plot and rhyme. See Artemis bathing.
The moonlight on her body is the mother
Of God. It makes perfect sense. I am eaten
And fed changeless into her breast, blood
Violet alive. I remain your friend.",Nature
I’m on the boating lake with Sean,"I’m gently rowing and the birds look sewn
to the surface of the water as it undulates to the sound
of Sean talking beautifully about something
I don’t really understand. But all I’m picturing

the bottom seams that have recorded the way
sausage rolls have touched them, or the thin waists
of dogs as depicted in medieval hunting frescos, or
a cherub’s fat little hand gesturing
to a vista where smiling families are meeting
to picnic with the animals that God
has also saved, or I’m thinking about
the mechanics of bagpipes, the legs and arms
and the fat belly and the long neck with its holes.
This has been the best day ever. Sean smiles.

Instead of Bad News about a Person I Love,"I got a letter through the post decreeing my sainthood.
Beatified, I sat down, because this was big news for me.
Bless the television, bless this chair of four wooden legs.
I felt like calling my parents, but thought, in a saintly way,
to do so would be immodest, so instead I opened the curtains.
Rain was washing everything that seemed in need of washing.
A bird landed on a bush and shook water from its wings
and I closed my eyes briefly, acknowledging its small,
hardworking soul, like a microchip destined for heaven.
The cat came in, little devil, and I forgave her, touching
under her chin, sweet child. We watched the news together
and reflected that this was how the world churns
its butter of beginnings and endings in front of the sun.
What good, I wondered laterally, might befall an ancient
tree today? Perhaps merely nothing much. Perhaps a tree
will carry on just as it was. What minerals will develop
unseen in the earth, deep beneath a human tragedy?
Some minerals. Some salty, bright minerals in the dark.

No soul on site, no signal/bars,

I’ll break each hamlet’s stop or yield.
I’ll fix some noodles, start a fire
and climb up to the topmost field.

You live inside its sound effects
whole weeks on end: its pin machine,
its cardboard drum, its soft-boiled eggs,
its silent running submarine.

It’s like the god of liquid rub-
ber stirred at dawn to slip downstairs
and sip a cigarette, to drub
his fingertips on solid layers

you poured across last summer’s drought.
You love it, learn to, as it slows,
and even as you come to doubt
its dribs and drabs and pigeon toes.

Forget the welcome rain outstayed.
For days the leaves are parchment sheet
and wind hangs chimeless in the shade.
Still rain remains the point of heat.

The rain is near. Like everything,
it’s best those seconds just before:
the broadleaf ’s backwards canvas sling,
the fly strip flapping through the door.

The wind’s this ancient bloke below
who chunters “we,” who wheezes “us,”
though no one else will come or go.
You want to ask the wind “Who’s us?”

but hold your tongue till, in your head,
the wind and him have somehow mixed,
the type of wind that loves a shed
and banging on of things not fixed:

a belt-and-braces year-round wind,
a kiln-dried cobwebbed hardwood wind,
a greenhouse wind, a treebound wind,
an end-of-season car-boot wind,

a padlocked shower unit wind,
an upturned wheelie dumpster wind,
a channel not quite tuned-in wind,
a hollow flight-path thunder wind,

a dog-eared wind, a knocked-sign wind,
a spouseless phantom ocean-blown
autumnal graveyard Scots pine wind
who speaks in plurals, moves alone.



the grass

One night last June, in cups, in love
with pickled gin from bubbly flutes,
our clothes in coils about the stove,
we climbed the dark in birthday suits.

It’s true! The grass was mown that day.
Like hippies chained in meadow flowers,
we tripped above the cut and lay
in blades of petrol suede for hours.

We listened to the lowing black.
We giggled, kissed. We possumed dead.
We woke as flesh and straggled back
like beasts for parlor, dressed, then read.

We trafficked grass in bedspreads, shoes,
and never spoke of that again
through winter’s interregnum blues,
of being spooked by skin, of when

the only care we had was grass,
the only stir for miles around

and I hobbled behind him.
When he plucked an iris, I plucked the one next to it,

When he killed a butterfly, he’d take off the wings first,
then crush it with his fingers and smell it.
I tried to catch one, but it flitted away.
He wanted to build a huge power plant
to keep us from disappearing. I nodded
and pointed out all the recent deaths, how quick they were,
tomatoes not as plump as they used to be,
the maple trees discolored, their branches
like veins with no fat around them.
All this, he decided, meant we needed new things.

for wanting too much. The next time I saw him
he was in bed, old and delirious.

What hand can you offer one wanting
just to get even for what it doesn’t know what,

just to take out what it feels on someone else
to hurt because it can’t get at where it hurts      itself

to have to see to clear like a movie fakes
done seeing sharper than thought can cut to it;

what hand can you offer one that doesn’t know even
as a balance any other than more as my half and

who counts itself that much     more
and that more proofless     multiple unanswerably human hurts

because it can’t figure out a figure to answer how it wants

Just as there were reeds along the riverbank,
Just as there were clouds
Above my head, my lute was lying beside me on the grass.

I placed the little finger of my right hand on the soundboard,
Just below the strings.
Not the tip of the finger, the side.

I curled the palm of my right hand towards me,
Covering the strings, so that I played
The bass note with the thumb,
The next with the index,
And the top note with the third.

The sun retreated, the night turned cold.
Rain began to fall, softly at first,
Though surely rain had fallen here before, as rain falls everywhere.

With my left hand, I positioned my thumb and index finger
Opposite each other, bearing no weight,
As if the neck of the lute were not there.

At this they all laughed.

Then the Count began afresh: My lords, he said, I am not pleased with the young man if he is not also a musician, and if, besides his cunning upon the book, he have not skill in like manner on sundry instruments. There is no ease of labor more honest and more praiseworthy, especially at court, where many things are taken in hand to please women, whose tender breasts are soon pierced with melody.

Then the Lord Gasper: I believe music, he said, together with other vanities, is mete for women, also for them that have the likeness of men, but not for them that be men indeed, who ought not with such delicacies womanize their minds and so bring themselves to dread death.

For many years I lived apart, in happy oblivion.
In retrospect, I understand I’d been a child,
Though lacking comparisons I couldn’t have said so.

I learned things, things no child, left to himself, could possibly know.
My head, which had been empty, now was full.

My head would grow larger.
How could it not?

At night, standing in the shower, I closed my eyes.
The water trickled down my forehead
To my nose, from my nose to my lips, my chin, then disappeared.

But some of what stayed in my head
Should not have been there.

Are weeping for Daphnis.
His mother embraces his body, railing against the stars.

Nobody drives his cattle to the cool stream, no one could drink;
The mountains echo with the beasts of the desert.

Daphnis, it was you who yoked them to the chariot,
Who led us in the dance, weaving
Together vine leaves with reeds.

The vine exceeds the tree on which it climbs.
The grape exceeds the vine,
The calf the herd, the corn the field.

Now, where we planted barley, thistles grow.
Where once were violets, hyacinths — nothing but weeds.

Scatter the ground with flowers, shepherds,
Set out two bowls,
One of milk and one of oil.
Then carve these lines from Virgil on his tomb:

I was Daphnis in these woods.
The stars knew my name.
Beautiful the flock, more beautiful the shepherd.",Mythology and Folklore
Dialogue with an Artist,"the lonely


Incorporating the words of L.S. Lowry


I used to paint the sea, but never a shore,
and nobody was sailing on it. It wasn’t even
the sea, it was just my own loneliness.

It’s all there, you know. It’s all in the sea.
The battle is there, the inevitability of it all,
the purpose. When I switched to people

they were all lonely. Crowds are the
loneliest thing of all, I say. Every individual
in them is a stranger to everyone else.

I would stand for hours in one spot
and scores of little kids who hadn’t had
a wash for weeks would group round me.

Had I not been lonely, none of my work
would have happened. I should not have
done what I’ve done, or seen what I’ve seen.

There’s something grotesque in me and I
can’t help it. I’m drawn to others who are
like that. They’re very real people. It’s just

I’m attracted to sadness and there are some
very sad things. These people are ghostly
figures. They’re my mood, they’re myself.

Lately, I started a big self-portrait. I thought
I won’t want this thing, no one will, so
I went and turned it into a grotesque head.


memo to lowry


You’re right, there are grotesques who shine
a dark light that lures us like how the sirens
tried to lure Odysseus, and yes, maybe we
ourselves are among the grotesques, but
there are also the beautiful who, if we’re
lucky, save us from ourselves, and validate
the sun’s light, and maybe also the moon’s.",Mythology and Folklore

Consider Oedipus’s Father,"It could have been a car door
                leaving that bruise,

as any mom knows,
almost anything could take an eye out,

and almost anybody could get their tongue
                frozen to a pole,

which is kind of funny
                to the point of tears

beats sitting in a car and hearing
                someone you love
                sob,
which I have done
with a black eye.

For me, a woman’s tears
are IKEA instructions

I’m sure for Laius, Oedipus’s father, it was the same.
                Think of him sleeping
after having held a crying Jocasta
because they had fought for hours
because she was stronger.

                Who knew better the anger of young Jocasta?
Knew that when the oracle, or the police,
                come, they are taking someone with them.

I’m sure Laius looked at the crib

The Dancing Plague,"Who was the woman who lived in the kingdom behind the barrier.
There are those who will tell you she was the wife of every man in the village.
And one night while her husbands were finishing their day at the gasworks,
the woman was boiling oats for her only child,
a young girl who’d amassed a beautiful collection of spoons in her life,
each one given to her by one of her mother’s husbands.
And this same night the young daughter died.
And the woman buried the daughter with her spoons in her pockets.
Come daybreak the hostiles appeared at the barrier with ice in their beards.
“To hell with Pax Americana,” they said.
And they camped outside the wall that night chanting war cries.
You say you want to know the names of the war cries that survived history.
“Wheel the gun carriages up to the barrier of the empire of husbands.”
“Our first word is ruin and our next word is value.”
There are those who will tell you the hostiles carried on like this for some weeks.
Until one night the dead daughter led them behind the barrier,
through a tunnel she’d dug in the earth with her spoons.
It was thus the hostiles made it their business to burn everything.
They burned the village crops and the distillery.
They burned the apothecary, the potash mine.
Black soot fell on the livery and they burned the livery too.
And there’s another war cry that’s since survived history:
“Tonight like god’s scalp in your kingdom behind the barrier
our burning makes snow and ends nowhere.”
You say, where were the village husbands while all of this was happening.
There are those who will tell you they were working their jobs at the gasworks,
and when they heard the bullhorn roar in the watchtower
they were smoking cigarillos and pacing the floor of the gasworks.
And the roar of the bullhorn had a strange effect on the husbands,
who each began daydreaming of his wife at home in the village.
The first husband thought: “The taste of the breath of my wife,
it’s like saying the word houndstooth to myself in the dark.”
The next husband thought of her letting her hair down in front of a vanity,
and smearing her blue eye shadow onto her fingers,
and plucking the stray hairs and flyaways off her head.
The next husband thought of her saying, “I’m correcting god’s blunders,”
when he asked her why she wears all this foundation on her face.
Another husband thought: “Quitting time is worthless to me
so long as the work I do in the gasworks makes me think of my wife’s jawbone.”
And all together the husbands said: “The jawbones of my wife,
they beat both the same, like when I watch a train leave the kingdom,
and all I can see is the pistons beating away in the smoke.”
And when the hostiles entered the gasworks the husbands were dancing.
And you say you want to know the words the hostiles spoke when they entered.
There are those who will tell you they said this: “Don’t quit dancing.”
“There’s a penalty for an empire that believes it can survive itself,” they said.
And so they pointed their war clubs at the husbands,
and they said don’t quit, don’t quit dancing on the floor of the gasworks,
and they bludgeoned to death the husbands who refused to keep dancing,
and one by one the husbands fell dead on the floor of the gasworks,
each one dancing himself to death at the hands of the hostiles.

And this dancing took many deaths.

But you say where was the wife who lost all her husbands this day.
There are those who will tell you she was hiding the last of the cheese in a boot.
She was rolling up the deed to her house in the village.
She was picking up her daughter’s violin and stuffing the scroll in the violin’s f-hole.
She was fleeing for the wall when she was stopped by the hostiles.
Dance, said the hostiles, and they pointed their war clubs at her skull.
And these war clubs had a strange effect on the wife,
who began daydreaming about a man who wasn’t her husband.
She thought of cutting his hair in a sunflower patch in the village.
The time should be dusk, she thought, and the shears,
they should flash once in her hands like a scythe.
She thought there should be two swarms of no-see-ums,
one smoldering around each of her hands.
And she’d tilt back the head of the man who wasn’t her husband.
And she’d oil his throat with the badger brush in her hand.
And he’d smell the sandalwood lather she worked in the bristles.
And he’d smell the eau de cologne on her neck when she leaned in close.
And she’d shave his throat with the blade of a balisong.
And the woman thought each time he moaned when she stroked him
a dragonfly should dance from his mouth.
And he’ll moan until the dragonfly quits dancing, she thought.
And I’ll dance around his throat all night like a lantern.
“Because a war club doesn’t taste like a war club,” she said.
“It tastes like my husbands all breathing at once.”
She spoke these words with a hole in her skull in the snow.
And the smoke coming out of the hole was her thoughts.
And her body lying there in the village square was so beautiful
the hostiles began to dance on either side of the body.
And they danced, and they danced, until they too fell dead in the snow beside her.",Mythology and Folklore

The Satyr Proffered,"These grapes of stone were being proffered, friend.
— John Berryman
grapes, rough-touched and round, stone-
carved, to be squeezed into the fundaments

not sought for its smoothness,
and likely full of grit
if not refined with care.

The satyr laughs carelessly
for one caught in stone.
The cracked edges of his mouth spill grit
as he leers after the loss of his fundaments
which fall along the smooth,
cold

torso plane, exhibiting immaculate coolness
at this literal loss of face. Carefully,
she strokes his head, as if smoothing
the fetlocks handcrafted from stone.
Her affection is unforced, a fundamental
attraction to those beautiful, gritty

things made lovely by decay, their gritted
teeth so much more interesting than the art gallery’s cold
geometrics, which appear fundamental
but fail to consider the careless
chaos spinning at the stone
center of all smooth

creations. And those grapes! Their unsmooth
surface mirrors the messy passion flushing the grit-
dusted cheek, the hideous mouth of crumbling stone.
What heat from the Dionysian’s cold,
brittle fruit! The obliteration of all care
if she could only perform the fundamental

act of eating. She thinks about wilderness, fun, mental
liberation, dancing her soles smooth,
pleasure as pervasive as care
is now, her feet a frenzied blur on the gritty
forest floor, shaking and pummeling out the cold
as she prances over starlit stones.

She does not care who sees her, as she grips the stone
grapes, feels the smooth, crumbling cold

with guns they hid in walls & under mattresses. I want those little spitty,
screamy dinosaurs. I want Cicely Tyson to make a speech, maybe two.
I want Viola Davis to save the city in the last scene with a black fist afro pick
through the last dinosaur’s long, cold-blood neck. But this can’t be
a black movie. This can’t be a black movie. This movie can’t be dismissed

because of its cast or its audience. This movie can’t be a metaphor
for black people & extinction. This movie can’t be about race.
This movie can’t be about black pain or cause black people pain.
This movie can’t be about a long history of having a long history with hurt.
This movie can’t be about race. Nobody can say nigga in this movie

who can’t say it to my face in public. No chicken jokes in this movie.
No bullets in the heroes. & no one kills the black boy. & no one kills
the black boy. & no one kills the black boy. Besides, the only reason
I want to make this is for that first scene anyway: the little black boy

Translated from the Polish",Mythology and Folklore
From “Ithaca”,"The night approaches. Dusk drafts on buildings
their future ruins. Dusk deepens windows
and apertures. It hollows stones
with shadows like with water. It foretells
the near death of a hundred clouds
to the shining host. A thin layer of dust,
the seer leaves his footprints on the roofs
as he walks home from the future
not his own, swallowing his voice —
in its rays, fat blood flows down
the golden armor. Wet
blue entrails. Large heads
have rolled down the shoulders.
Speech has grown silent in deep mouths.
.................................................

The signs of a life without past will emerge
like lies through the lines of an old page,
emptiness will turn into loss,
foreign sand into Ithaca.

Ithaca is the time
when there’s nowhere to go. If it’s night,
it means the night is the end of the voyage.
A sackcloth hiding the shoulders
of the stranger is truer than
speeches about past and future
he won’t make. Nobody
will. On the streets rain readies 
hollows for the funeral, already
overgrown with grass.

In a long puddle he sees:
a pauper, a random victim of the skies
hangs with his head down.
In height, he is a cloud, the size
of a lost faith
in returning home.
.......................

So should I, a pauper sitting
by a stranger’s door, declare: I’m Odysseus,
and I’m back. Should I say:
I’m recognized. After the mourning songs
tears are still rolling down my face. I have been
summoned to clothe the past
in the shining ice.

The twilight pushes a heavy box of reflection
out of the windows
and thumbs through a pale face
as if it were a stack of letters lying in a vacuum,
written by an unfamiliar hand. 
You are in Ithaca, but you are not yet home.

The soul goes home the way of flesh,
clothed in white rags,
so that to say
upon arrival: I recognize
and I am recognized. Window water,
vapor of window reflections
harden not in the shining of the ice
that has come out of a secret thought,
but from a permanent neighboring frame,
which has embraced life into its shores of death,
where my steps on the sand
are uneven and filled with water.

Old rags are stronger than old life.
Night, like dead water, sows together
the tattered contours of the past. 
A stranger’s death is a seed of your homeland,
sprouting from the graveyard statues,
from the clouds, forever still.


Translated from the Russian",Mythology and Folklore
"Tinnitus: January, thin rain becoming ice","Now footsteps on shingle. Make of it what you will. Seabirds roost
on the breakwaters, accustomed, of course, to twilight.
The spirit lamp in that house on the headland could easily fall and spill
and the fire burn all night. Some time later a subtle ghost,
yourself  in memory perhaps, might well set foot
up there amid clinker and smoke, the whole place silent and still
except you bring in the tic of cooling timbers, and then the birds in flight.

  A new lady named Ahdja joined our group,
    slight of limb, loose tomboy body, smile so
broad we blushed. The Egyptian spring was
                                                                      up
      in smoke in back of us, we trudged on, far
  from all that, even far from Lone Coast, a
    former life stalked us it seemed... We took
                                                                       tiny
steps, unsure what lay under us, unlay’s realm
    the sweet precinct we sought, unsure what
  would get us there... To say we was too much

  say we was all I wanted my third head said, sec-

      odds with itself, want wanting more of itself...
  It was Ahdja’s dream we were in, the we I went

  Unlay was no simple stand, this or that mystic
    hustle, this or that bodily rebuke. In the end
it will have been all there was we grew to expect,

of it, there no matter where we were. Moment’s
    notice moment’s gnosis, the moment brought bad

     crew caught up in the old way, the old way’s day
  redone... “Madness be our name,” we chimed in
    unison, incensed, Majnun’s dream of a just world
just dreaming, Majnun’s each and all we were. So

      from inside we saw was what soul was. “This is how
  it is,” I was telling myself, some spectral aspect it had
    somehow. “This is how it is,” I said, “this is how it
is,” voice eaten at by the bay we stood in front of, cold
                                                                                      ad-
    vent of water, cold commiseration, ythmic arrival,
      salt... If not what wet our hems anointment was
nothing, nothing if not what tugged our feet. “Froth be

    was a core to be gotten to, cloth drawn aside or
  gone under, frills fallen away at the water’s edge...

Attack Underground,"Themiscyra, 72 BC
While Lucullus raided cherry orchards,
he left us to besiege,

Not one of us has seen

Meanwhile, we dug a tomb.

We intended it as the tunnel
through which we’d claim the fort.
We shored up the sifting roof
and dug by lamps
that shed more shadows than light.
At last we formed up underground
to attack with sword and fire,

And each night I’d watch as my hero curled
himself round home plate, as if he were going
to bat for me. And I’d hold my breath, knowing
a strong enough shot might be heard round the world.
 
One must imagine Penelope.

One must imagine Schliemann excavating

the remains of Achilles’s rage on his shirt.
What does not kill you can still hurt.

Penelope’s suitors are striking out,
one after another. Their sad swings and misses.
They can’t even get to first base. She’ll cut
the stitches once more, then blow them all kisses.

Odysseus won’t care that the orb is undone.
He’ll take a swing at it with all his might.
The ball takes flight. Odysseus takes flight.
It feels to Penelope like he’s been gone

The Ships of Theseus,"The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians    ...    for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.
— Plutarch, Vita Thesel
The answer of course is that the ship
doesn’t exist, that “ship”
is an abstraction, a conception,
an imaginary tarp thrown
across the garden of the real.
The answer is that the cheap
peasantry of things toils all day
in the kingdom of  language,
every ship like a casket
of words: bulkhead, transom,
mast steps. The answer
is to wake again to the banality
of things, to wade toward
the light inside the plasma
of ideas. But each plank
is woven from your mother’s
hair. The blade of each oar
contains the shadow of
a horse. The answer
is that the self is the glue between
the boards, the cartilage
that holds a world together,
that self is the wax in
the stenographer’s ears,
that there is nothing the mind
won’t sacrifice, each item
another goat tossed into
the lava of our needs.
The answer is that this is just
another poem about divorce,
about untombing the mattress
from the sofa, your body
laid out on the bones of the
double-jointed frame, about
separation, rebuilding, about
your daughter’s missing
teeth. Each time you visit
now you find her partially
replaced, more sturdily
jointed, the weathered joists
of   her childhood being stripped
away. New voice. New hair.
The answer is to stand there
redrawing the constellation
of   the word daughter in
your brain while she tries
to understand exactly who
you are, and breathes out
girl after girl into the entry-
way, a fog of   strangers that
almost evaporates when
you say each other’s
names. Almost, but not quite.
Let it be enough. Already,
a third ship moves
quietly toward you in the night.",Mythology and Folklore
A Tale Told by Atheneus (Venus Callipygus),"Two sisters of ancient Greece both laid claim
To the finest, fairest rear of their time.

Topped? Which back was in front, which terce most prime?
A judge chose the elder girl’s back matter;
Her finish was more fine and far matter.
She got the prize, and his heart; soon they wed.
“But the younger’s sitter’s not a smatter
Less meet; I’ll marry her,” his brother said.
It went so well, their joys were so perfected,

In honor of  Venus Callipygus.

Close the small doors of the heart via a template of hardened wax, a temple of vital gases, water with grass seed suspension, glass blown through a cast of calcined gypsum, plaster of Santo Spirito.

Is, sub specie aeternitatis,

A pluperfect halo, both circle and square,
And a premonition of this truth
Spurred on an ancient philosopher,

Attempts to approximate the circle
Of his concerns with the square of the cell
He was jailed in for impiety.
Doomed calculations which God acknowledged

By doffing then pancaking his topper.
He was still bareheaded millennia later,
When he learned of von Lindemann’s proof that pi
Is not the root of a polynomial

With rational coefficients, hence
Squaring the circle’s impossible.

Progress was a juggernaut
And the public had no patience for “proof.”

Proper in their headgear, for nations,
Well-stocked with helmets for delicate brainwork,
To take up “the compass and straightedge”
And prepare for a singular all-out attack

— John Freeman

Thrillers like The Da Vinci Code are one of the key indicators of contemporary ideological shifts.
— Slavoj Žižek
For what might break a writer’s block that grips
my pen as if King Arthur’s sword, I quest
through bookshops of My Lady Charity
in Urbs Leodiensis Mystica,
completely outside Freeman’s (as most) worlds,
where locals speak blank verse (says Harrison);
Back-to-Front Inside-Out Upside-Down Leeds,
according to the Nuttgens book I bagged
along with authors promising keys to open
secrets of iambic pentameter,
how it’s a ball and chain, a waltz — but best,
in Žižek’s wind sock for the New World Order,
Gnostic code imprinted by five feet
that lead us to a Grail Brown liquefies
as Shakespeare melts to decasyllabics
like congealed saint’s blood in a Naples shrine.
Brown quotes from Philip’s Gospel where it suits
to build on Rosslyn Chapel’s premises
vast hypophetic labyrinths in the air
yet blind to masons’ mysteries below,
who carved among the seven virtues greed
with charity being made a deadly sin    ...
The world was made in error, Philip wrote —
Savonarola, in The Rule of Four
(another blockbuster from Oxfam’s shelves)
is made to quote “the Gospel of Paul” —
does error here disguise some secret truth?
What if  Paul’s Gospel were real, a Gnostic text
thrown on the Bonfire of the Vanities
so seen there by our zealot’s burning eyes,
its road map to the true Grail turning to ash?
My back-to-back looks on a blind man’s road
to Wilfred’s city, where he came from Rome
to blitz our monks for “Simon Magus” tonsures
after that Gnostic heresiarch
a dog denounces in St. Peter’s Acts,
while Peter raised smoked tuna from the dead,
explained his crucifixion upside down,
then how God’s Kingdom might be found on Earth:
make right your left, back forwards, low your high    ...

“Lucretius grabbed my arm and led me”,"Lucretius grabbed my arm and led me
to the spot where he went nuts. I watered little

Terrible — burnt on the stake, squatted, too.
My god, I beat him up his ass. Puff, puff, but
no one had heard a thing. Now here, I’m flooded
with flowers by cumin. Even Tarkovsky appears.
Now I will suck you with my thumbs, mold
you like clay with my horns, till he’d vaporize and
see into what and where I’ve traveled to. Into
honor. Into white birch trees. Into the pouch
used for bread. I hung around the world a lot,
frothily crushing the mountain range. With no
avail, with no day’s pay, sticky are my laws.
I protected an elephant as much as I could,
stared at the back of the horse. Joshed the others

the house like crazy skeletons: loose

with all our bones knocking, we go,
“click click click” and wave our arms
and shake until we rattle all the china
in mom’s cabinet. He turns the volume
up and we spin like planets round the sun.
Babe says he’s no fun but I know different
because I see him laughing and I try,

which she just never does. She walks
into the house with Jasper waiting in the car.
She grabs some clothes or asks for money,
though she doesn’t even come to do that
anymore. They don’t even talk. Last time
we had the music on loud and we were dancing.
I was letting my head swing back and forth

and she just stood and watched us with the strangest
look and I said, “I’m Shakey Eyes! Come dance,”
and moved my arms around. I followed her up
the stairs, swinging like a satellite and going,
“Ooh ooh ooooohhhhh,” just like a low-down good-
for-nothing so and so. I know she thinks I’m funny

I said. You all stared at me. “Why,

“Why not?” I said. “He was a good
man, a better man than me. And
look at what I’ve brought you —

“Easy to dismiss that,” you said.
“We appreciated it all. And you

Is that after all it is not fleeting
After all it is so gross to be that way

I painted my lips, my eyes

To perform is to be malleable

To perform in language

The large purple insect I let in the room
Or was it the furred face — the hippo or the gorge

Lives of the Poets,"One stood among the violets

I’m boiling some milk thistle.
I hope it will turn into a winged thesis

One removed his shoes
and yearned off a bridge. One lives
with Alzheimer’s in a state facility, spittle
in his white beard. It
turns out words are no help.
But here I am with my shovel
digging like a fool
beside the spilth and splosh
of the ungirdled sea. I can’t stop.
The horses are coming, the thieves.
I still haven’t found lasting love.
I still want to hear viols
in the little beach hotel

I want to see again the fish

                            of night. Without product placement, poetry
                            as we know it

                                                                              cannot sur-

                      Poetry should not be in the service of art any more than religion, ideology,
                      or morality. Poetry should be in the service of nothing — and not even
                      that.

                       If  you can identify someone as gnostic they are probably

                     not

gnostic enough,

                                                     for my money.

            I believe in my disbelief, have faith in my reason.

                      The sacred in a poem is nowhere seen and everywhere

                      felt. There’s

                more to transgression than

                                                                           ritual, but not enough

more. There is more

               to liturgy than doctrine,

       once in a blue

I left my purpose in my other pants.

       You’re not the only paddle in the ocean, shadow in the dark, line in
       the poem, lobster in the trap, pot on the stove, wheel on the truck,
       letter on the keypad, scythe in the field, lever on the controls, cloud
       in the sky, fruit in the tree, rat in the lab.

                 Reality is usually a poor copy of the imitation. The original
            is an echo of what is yet to be.

                                  Time is neither linear nor circular; it is excremental.

       Beauty is the memory of the loss of time.

                                    Memory
                                    is
                                    the
                                    reflection
                                    of
                                    the
                                    loss
                                    of
                                    beauty.

               American poetry suffers from its lack of

     uncreativity. I have no faith in faith, or hope
                                  for hope, no belief  in belief, no doubt of doubt.

                                                        They say God is in the details. That’s
                                                  because the Devil has the rest

                                   covered.

God is weak and imaginary — a flickering possibility. The dogma of an
omniscient and omnipotent God maligns hope and denies the sacred, as
it turns its back on the world.

        God has no doctrine, no morality, no responsibility. To sin against
    God is to use that name to justify any action or prohibition, whether
    murder or martyrdom.

                                                    Saying one more time:
                                                    It’s true but I don’t believe it
                                                    I believe it but it’s not so.

My meninas are as changeable as the moon.
Black and white and in color.
Happy, sad, and how many words there are
for red enough and the pallor of skin.

Their moments of verisimilitude do not outweigh
their flashes of pathos. Whole days go by
when they cannot appreciate the humor
of which the dog is one manner, the dwarf another.

My meninas are not puppets, but puppet theaters.
That it is the puppet master who draws the curtain
in the stairwell is pure whimsy on my part.
A minuet of despair, andante of foolhardiness.

How many times have I tried to explain these differences,
the sting of  joy, a lilt of crimson,
the dark and the light of the moon not the moon,
the soul but a sphere predisposed to rotation?

The man in the doorway. The dog who lies sleeping.
These are my meninas. The sun in the mirror.
The sun and the moon and the man behind the easel,
mostly invisible, like the pictures on the wall.

The moon is not more changeable, however,
than they, my meninas, who never stop changing
and waiting on the children of the sun
and of the moon, for they will always be

my meninas, their eyes of every minim on the palette,
blue and tragical, white on white against
a black ground, until the moon sings every shape

Visitors from Abroad,"1


Sometime after I had entered
that time of   life
people prefer to allude to in others
but not in themselves, in the middle of the night
the phone rang. It rang and rang
as though the world needed me,
though really it was the reverse.

I lay in bed, trying to analyze
the ring. It had
my mother’s persistence and my father’s
pained embarrassment.

When I picked it up, the line was dead.
Or was the phone working and the caller dead?
Or was it not the phone, but the door perhaps?

My mother and father stood in the cold
on the front steps. My mother stared at me,
a daughter, a fellow female.
You never think of us, she said.

We read your books when they reach heaven.
Hardly a mention of us anymore, hardly a mention of  your sister.
And they pointed to my dead sister, a complete stranger,
tightly wrapped in my mother’s arms.

But for us, she said, you wouldn’t exist.
And your sister — you have your sister’s soul.
After which they vanished, like Mormon missionaries.

The street was white again,
all the bushes covered with heavy snow
and the trees glittering, encased with ice.

I lay in the dark, waiting for the night to end.
It seemed the longest night I had ever known,
longer than the night I was born.

I write about you all the time, I said aloud.
Every time I say “I,” it refers to you.

Outside the street was silent.
The receiver lay on its side among the tangled sheets,
its peevish throbbing had ceased some hours before.

I left it as it was;
its long cord drifting under the furniture.

I watched the snow falling,
not so much obscuring things
as making them seem larger than they were.

He was jailed in for impiety.
Doomed calculations which God acknowledged

By doffing then pancaking his topper.

Well-stocked with helmets for delicate brainwork,
To take up “the compass and straightedge”

— John Freeman

Thrillers like The Da Vinci Code are one of the key indicators of contemporary ideological shifts.
— Slavoj Žižek
For what might break a writer’s block that grips
my pen as if King Arthur’s sword, I quest
through bookshops of My Lady Charity
in Urbs Leodiensis Mystica,
completely outside Freeman’s (as most) worlds,
where locals speak blank verse (says Harrison);
Back-to-Front Inside-Out Upside-Down Leeds,
according to the Nuttgens book I bagged
along with authors promising keys to open
secrets of iambic pentameter,
how it’s a ball and chain, a waltz — but best,
in Žižek’s wind sock for the New World Order,
Gnostic code imprinted by five feet
that lead us to a Grail Brown liquefies
as Shakespeare melts to decasyllabics
like congealed saint’s blood in a Naples shrine.
Brown quotes from Philip’s Gospel where it suits
to build on Rosslyn Chapel’s premises
vast hypophetic labyrinths in the air
yet blind to masons’ mysteries below,
who carved among the seven virtues greed
with charity being made a deadly sin    ...
The world was made in error, Philip wrote —
Savonarola, in The Rule of Four
(another blockbuster from Oxfam’s shelves)
is made to quote “the Gospel of Paul” —
does error here disguise some secret truth?
What if  Paul’s Gospel were real, a Gnostic text
thrown on the Bonfire of the Vanities
so seen there by our zealot’s burning eyes,
its road map to the true Grail turning to ash?
My back-to-back looks on a blind man’s road
to Wilfred’s city, where he came from Rome
to blitz our monks for “Simon Magus” tonsures
after that Gnostic heresiarch
a dog denounces in St. Peter’s Acts,
while Peter raised smoked tuna from the dead,
explained his crucifixion upside down,
then how God’s Kingdom might be found on Earth:
make right your left, back forwards, low your high    ...
quite suddenly, like Paul I saw the light
through Peter’s apophatic paradox,
my block was my von Eschenbach stone grail,

“Lucretius grabbed my arm and led me”,"Lucretius grabbed my arm and led me
to the spot where he went nuts. I watered little
drums right away and entangled the Sava River
with knitting needles. I putrefied a small soup,
dismembered seven towels. There, He — The
Terrible — burnt on the stake, squatted, too.
My god, I beat him up his ass. Puff, puff, but
no one had heard a thing. Now here, I’m flooded
with flowers by cumin. Even Tarkovsky appears.
Now I will suck you with my thumbs, mold
you like clay with my horns, till he’d vaporize and
see into what and where I’ve traveled to. Into
honor. Into white birch trees. Into the pouch
used for bread. I hung around the world a lot,
frothily crushing the mountain range. With no
avail, with no day’s pay, sticky are my laws.
I protected an elephant as much as I could,
stared at the back of the horse. Joshed the others
now, too, tested spring mattresses. Kept
gulping nirvana. Loosened feathery leaves,
wrapped the emperor into a roll. To not let my
senses perish, to gallop without a break.",Mythology and Folklore

when that disaster is us. That’s what I love
about the shrug, it says zilch

I try to peak into speaking, the bag
of gab to learn what our noodles

That’s what my father said and took me
to the record store so we could buy him

he’s so square but we go all over. We listen
to music for hours and dance around
the house like crazy skeletons: loose

with all our bones knocking, we go,
“click click click” and wave our arms
and shake until we rattle all the china
in mom’s cabinet. He turns the volume
up and we spin like planets round the sun.
Babe says he’s no fun but I know different
because I see him laughing and I try,

which she just never does. She walks
into the house with Jasper waiting in the car.
She grabs some clothes or asks for money,
though she doesn’t even come to do that
anymore. They don’t even talk. Last time
we had the music on loud and we were dancing.
I was letting my head swing back and forth

and she just stood and watched us with the strangest
look and I said, “I’m Shakey Eyes! Come dance,”
and moved my arms around. I followed her up
the stairs, swinging like a satellite and going,
“Ooh ooh ooooohhhhh,” just like a low-down good-
for-nothing so and so. I know she thinks I’m funny

I said. You all stared at me. “Why,
Bernard? Of course we won’t.”
“Why not?” I said. “He was a good
man, a better man than me. And
look at what I’ve brought you —
rubbish, dodgy tales, dross.”
“Easy to dismiss that,” you said.
“We appreciated it all. And you
wandered the wild paths to bring
it back to us — your songs, your
legends, magic stories, your gold.”

By the room where I keep my bed

What people don’t understand about beauty
Is that after all it is not fleeting
After all it is so gross to be that way
That someone sees among you

I painted my lips, my eyes
Only our scholars know that
To perform is to be malleable

To perform in language
Or was it
The large purple insect I let in the room
Or was it the furred face — the hippo or the gorge

That I was the devil in the wood
In my own bones that I knew the face
That I took that face

What sense of exquisite cause

Moves you past these lines
Into conversation

Through time
What skin sack

I mean for what, why,
Or who

I’m boiling some milk thistle.
I hope it will turn into a winged thesis

One removed his shoes
and yearned off a bridge. One lives
with Alzheimer’s in a state facility, spittle
in his white beard. It

digging like a fool
beside the spilth and splosh
of the ungirdled sea. I can’t stop.

I still haven’t found lasting love.
I still want to hear viols

As dry as a bubble, as expectant as the dead

                            of night. Without product placement, poetry
                            as we know it

                                                                              cannot sur-

                      Poetry should not be in the service of art any more than religion, ideology,
                      or morality. Poetry should be in the service of nothing — and not even
                      that.

                       If  you can identify someone as gnostic they are probably

                     not

gnostic enough,

                                                     for my money.

            I believe in my disbelief, have faith in my reason.

                      The sacred in a poem is nowhere seen and everywhere

                      felt. There’s

                more to transgression than

                                                                           ritual, but not enough

more. There is more

               to liturgy than doctrine,

       once in a blue

I left my purpose in my other pants.

       You’re not the only paddle in the ocean, shadow in the dark, line in
       the poem, lobster in the trap, pot on the stove, wheel on the truck,
       letter on the keypad, scythe in the field, lever on the controls, cloud
       in the sky, fruit in the tree, rat in the lab.

                 Reality is usually a poor copy of the imitation. The original
            is an echo of what is yet to be.

                                  Time is neither linear nor circular; it is excremental.

       Beauty is the memory of the loss of time.

                                    Memory
                                    is
                                    the
                                    reflection
                                    of
                                    the
                                    loss
                                    of
                                    beauty.

               American poetry suffers from its lack of

     uncreativity. I have no faith in faith, or hope
                                  for hope, no belief  in belief, no doubt of doubt.

                                                        They say God is in the details. That’s
                                                  because the Devil has the rest

                                   covered.

God is weak and imaginary — a flickering possibility. The dogma of an
omniscient and omnipotent God maligns hope and denies the sacred, as
it turns its back on the world.

        God has no doctrine, no morality, no responsibility. To sin against
    God is to use that name to justify any action or prohibition, whether
    murder or martyrdom.

I’ve got authenticity, you’ve got dogma  ...    proclaimeth the Lord.

                                                    Saying one more time:
                                                    It’s true but I don’t believe it
                                                    I believe it but it’s not so.

My Meninas and the Moon,"I would try to do it in my way, forgetting Velázquez . . . .  So, little by little, I would paint my Meninas . . . they would be “my” Meninas.
                                           — Pablo Picasso
My meninas are as changeable as the moon.
Black and white and in color.
Happy, sad, and how many words there are
for red enough and the pallor of skin.

Their moments of verisimilitude do not outweigh
their flashes of pathos. Whole days go by
when they cannot appreciate the humor
of which the dog is one manner, the dwarf another.

My meninas are not puppets, but puppet theaters.
That it is the puppet master who draws the curtain
in the stairwell is pure whimsy on my part.
A minuet of despair, andante of foolhardiness.

How many times have I tried to explain these differences,
the sting of  joy, a lilt of crimson,
the dark and the light of the moon not the moon,
the soul but a sphere predisposed to rotation?

The man in the doorway. The dog who lies sleeping.
These are my meninas. The sun in the mirror.
The sun and the moon and the man behind the easel,
mostly invisible, like the pictures on the wall.

The moon is not more changeable, however,
than they, my meninas, who never stop changing
and waiting on the children of the sun
and of the moon, for they will always be

my meninas, their eyes of every minim on the palette,
blue and tragical, white on white against
a black ground, until the moon sings every shape
and shade of gray from hope to ample. And again.",Mythology and Folklore
Night Nurse,"This night nurse is different.
She walks into my room and does not turn the light on.
She thinks I am sleeping.
I have just barely opened my left eye,
am looking through the slightest slit,
as moonlight exposes the room
for what it really is — a collection
of surfaces; lines and planes, mostly.
The night nurse puts a foot up on the radiator
and braces her clipboard on her knee
as she appears to take down a few notes.
I imagine she is working on a sonnet,
and that her ankle looks like polished walnut.
You imagine she is working on a crossword,
and that her feet are killing her.
The slightest slit is like an old gate
at a Japanese tea garden at night,
in the rain, that is supposed to be closed,
that is supposed to be locked.
“Someone has locked up poorly,” you’d say.
“Incorrectly.” But no one has asked you.",Mythology and Folklore

pretends to know

sky looks down
for an instant
through my sleepy
isolate frame
a complex child
hologram flickers
angrily holding
a green plastic shovel
then disappears
leaving an empty
column waiting
Bill who I knew
was so angry
is dead
whatever he was
going through
I kept away
I never did
anything
I love his poem
he was really good
I keep forgetting
his last name

his handmade book
on my desk
not to remember

Rain of Statues,"From the Mithridatic Wars,  first century BC
Our general was elsewhere, but we drowned.
While he rested, he shipped us home
with the bulk of  his spoils
that had weighed his army down.
The thrashing storm
that caught us cracked the hulls
and made us offerings to the sea floor —
a rain of statues, gold, and men.

Released from service,
done with war,
the crash and hiss muted,
we fell through streams of creatures
whose lives were their purpose.
We settled with treasure looted
from temples of rubbled Athenian Greece;
among us, bronze and marble gods and goddesses
moored without grace,
dodged by incurious fish.
Their power was never meant to buoy us —
our pleasures were incidental gifts —
but, shaken by their radiance in our dust,
we had given them our voices.

Their faces, wings, and limbs
lie here with our sanded bones
and motionless devices.
Little crabs attempt to don rings
set with agate and amethyst,
and many an octopus,
seeking an hour of rest,
finds shelter in our brain-cases.
So we are still of use.",Mythology and Folklore

Envoy to Palestine,"I’ve come to this one grassy hill
in Ramallah, off Tokyo Street,
to place a few red anemones
& a sheaf of wheat on Darwish’s grave.
A borrowed line transported me beneath
a Babylonian moon & I found myself
lucky to have the shadow of a coat
as warmth, listening to a poet’s song
of Jerusalem, the hum of a red string
Caesar stole off Gilgamesh’s lute.
I know a prison of sunlight on the skin.
The land I come from they also dreamt
before they arrived in towering ships
battered by the hard Atlantic winds.
Crows followed me from my home.
My coyote heart is an old runagate
redskin, a noble savage, still Lakota,
& I knew the bow before the arch.
I feel the wildflowers, all the grasses
& insects singing to me. My sacred dead
is the dust of restless plains I come from,
& I love when it gets into my eyes & mouth
telling me of the roads behind & ahead.
I go back to broken treaties & smallpox,
the irony of barbed wire. Your envoy
could be a reprobate whose inheritance
is no more than a swig of firewater.
The sun made a temple of the bones
of my tribe. I know a dried-up riverbed
& extinct animals live in your nightmares
sharp as shark teeth from my mountains
strung into this brave necklace around
my neck. I hear Chief Standing Bear

Istanbul 1983,"In the frozen square, the student asks me if I will
sell him the books from my backpack. He hides them
under his winter coat. Steam rises from the whole
wheat rolls we break open at the breakfast table.
We drink hot apple tea and pronounce the skyline
“charming.” In a jail a man counts the visible bones,
and recounts them in the blaze of morning. To turn
a self to light proves painful — each piece must
be dissected in turn; you pass through every feeling
imaginable, so many you might make a dictionary —
dread to disgust, delight to degradation. The prisoner
remembers wanting only to read as if in a fever —
running fingers over pyramids of words as if he might
translate himself from this life to a more vivid existence
in which he cuts open the pages with a knife in
plain sight of everyone like a man eating meat and
potatoes at the dinner table. Not that world; this one
where blue light and sharpened files, where identikit
and stamps on passports, where the book in his back-
pack is a crime, and I have sold him down the river
for ideas I barely value — the volumes flung carelessly
across my hotel room, while he picks mushrooms on
the edge of dread, pallid ghosts of what won’t speak

be present in the world, and I turn away, unable to
bear it — so much light and dread, so much in the darkness

Akechi’s Wife,"On one occasion Yūgen of Ise Province was offering to share, for a night or two, the comforts of his home with me when a distant, bemused expression came over his face as though at the recollection of a joke told him earlier that day; then, to a degree I would not have thought possible in one whose normal manner was so formal, that studiedly dour professorial expression gave way for an instant to one that positively beamed, illuminated from within by the sound of a beloved voice. So worn out, not even sure I was on the right road, I forgot myself awhile watching in weary amazement as his wife came and went, the two of them giving the impression of having long perfected some grave and complex dance known only to them, one of accord and the affection of two people moving hand-in-hand in the same direction, both possessed by desire while knowing themselves to be the source of that desire. But I am so tired, I heard my own voice say, one of them, that startlingly cruel, intrusive voice I hate, darkening everything, how sick I am of listening to it, and of having to go on! But after some time had passed once again I forgot all about it as I sat there, the witness of this marvel that brought peace to my heart or, perhaps, a hidden joy of my own, one I had so long considered extinct. When Yūgen fell on hard times and was dragged down into the most humiliating poverty, his wife made up her mind one day to have her long beautiful hair cut short so that she could sell it and he could afford to invite all their friends to an evening of laughter and drinking, renga competitions, and the conversation of those who have known one another for a long time, the kind look and humorous word that make it seem possible to live again. I think of her sometimes.

Boardinghouse with No Visible Address,"So, I thought,
as the door was unlocked
and the landlord disappeared (no,
he actually disappeared)
and I got to examine the room
unobserved. There
it stood
in its gray corner:
the narrow bed, sheets
the color of old aspirin.
Maybe all this had occurred
somewhere inside me
already, or
was just about to.
Is there a choice?
Is there
even a difference? Familiar,
familiar but not
yet remembered ...
The small narrow bed.
I had often wondered
where I would find it, and
what it would look like.
Don’t you?
It was so awful
I couldn’t speak. Then
maybe you ought to lie down for a minute, I heard myself
thinking. I mean
if  you are having that much trouble
functioning. And when
was the last time
with genuine sorrow
and longing to change
you got on your knees?
I could get some work done
here, I shrugged;
I had done it before.
I would work without cease.
Oh, I would stay awake
if only from horror
at the thought of waking
up here. Ma,
a voice spoke from the darkness
in the back seat where
a long thin man lay,
arms crossed
on his chest,
while they cruised slowly up and down
straining to make out the numbers
over unlighted doors,
the midnight doctor’s;
in his hurt mind
he was already merging
with a black Mississippi
of mercy, the sweat pouring off him
as though he’d been doused
with a bucket of ice water
as he lay sleeping. “I saw the light,”
they kept screaming. “Do
I saw the light!”
Ma — there ain’t no light
I don’t see no light.

Someday I’ll go back to the place depicted
By the painting, boarded over by the layers of paint

And abandoned,

And beneath the pastel yellows I’ll find
The Bayside Motel & the little room

With the thin, rumpled coverlet,

And sit down, drinking nothing but the night air
By the window, & wait for her to finish

Dressing, one earring, then another,

And wait until the objects in the room take back
Their shapes in the dawn,

And wait until

Each rumpled crease in the sheets & pillowcase
Is as clear as a gift again, & wait —

At a certain moment, that room, then all the rooms
Of the empty Bayside,

All song is formal, and you
Maybe felt this and decided
You’d be formal too. (The eyeliner, the beehive: formal.)

When a desire to escape becomes formal,
It’s dangerous. Then escape requires
Nullity, rather than a walk in the park or a movie.
Eventually, nullity gets harder and
Harder to achieve. After surgery, I had
Opiates. I pushed the button as often as I could.
Understood by music was how I felt. An escape
So complete it became a song. After that,
Elegy’s the only necessary form.

Then you would be at peace, or
Else why does the mind punish the body?
Vengeance is mind, says the body.
Ever after, you’re a mirror, “silver and exact.”

Just like the bug in a string of code, the body defies the mind
Or looks in the mirror of the mind and shudders.

Ondine,"At supper time an ondine’s narrow feet
made dark tracks on the hearth.
Like the heart of a yellow fruit was the fire’s heat,
but they rubbed together quite blue with the cold.
The sandy hem of her skirt dripped on the floor.
She sat there with a silvered cedar knot
for a low stool; and I sat opposite,
my lips and eyelids hot
in the heat of the fire. Piling on dry bark,
seeing that no steam went up from her dark dress,
I felt uneasiness
as though firm sand had shifted under my feet
in the wash of a wave.

I brought her soup from the stove and she would not eat,
but sat there crying her cold tears,
her blue lips quivering with cold and grief.
She blamed me for a thief,
saying that I had burned a piece of wood
the tide washed up. And I said, No,
the tide had washed it out again; and even so,
a piece of sodden wood was not so rare
as polished agate stones or ambergris.

She stood and wrung her hair
so that the water made a sudden splash
on the round rug by the door. I saw her go
across the little footbridge to the beach.
After, I threw the knot on the hot coals.
It fell apart and burned with a white flash,
a crackling roar in the chimney and dark smoke.
I beat it out with a poker
in the soft ash.

Now I am frightened on the shore at night,
and all the phosphorescent swells that rise
come towards me with the threat of her dark eyes
with a cold firelight in them;
and crooked driftwood writhes
in dry sand when I pass.

Of the things beneath the sky. Of course, Eurydice was a part   
Of this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends   
Rocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks   
Can’t withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon   
To the other, almost ready to give up wholeness.   
Then Apollo quietly told him: “Leave it all on earth.   
Your lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to   
Follow, except a few birds of dusty feather,
Not vivid performances of the past.” But why not?   
All other things must change too.
The seasons are no longer what they once were,   
But it is the nature of things to be seen only once,
As they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along   
Somehow. That’s where Orpheus made his mistake.   
Of course Eurydice vanished into the shade;
She would have even if he hadn’t turned around.
No use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel   
Of recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to utter an intelligent
Comment on the most thought-provoking element in its train.   
Only love stays on the brain, and something these people,   
These other ones, call life. Singing accurately
So that the notes mount straight up out of the well of   
Dim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers   
Growing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulates   
The different weights of the things.

To just go on singing. Orpheus realized this
And didn’t mind so much about his reward being in heaven

Half out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them.
Some say it was for his treatment of Eurydice.
But probably the music had more to do with it, and   
The way music passes, emblematic
Of life and how you cannot isolate a note of it
And say it is good or bad. You must
Wait till it’s over. “The end crowns all,”
Meaning also that the “tableau”
Is wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example,   
Melt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure   
That stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting;   
It is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal,   
Over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt,   
Harsh strokes. And to ask more than this
Is to become the tossing reeds of that slow,
Powerful stream, the trailing grasses
Playfully tugged at, but to participate in the action   
No more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky   
Electric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth   
Into a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses   
Have each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks,   
“I’m a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me,   
Though I can understand the language of birds, and   
The itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me.
Their jousting ends in music much
As trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm   
And is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, day after day.”

But how late to be regretting all this, even
Bearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late!   
To which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours,   
Replies that these are of course not regrets at all,   
Merely a careful, scholarly setting down of
Unquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way.
And no matter how all this disappeared,   
Or got where it was going, it is no longer   
Material for a poem. Its subject
Matters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly   
While the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad   
Comet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward   
That the meaning, good or other, can never   
Become known. The singer thinks
Constructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages   
Like a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away.   
The song is engulfed in an instant in blackness   
Which must in turn flood the whole continent   
With blackness, for it cannot see. The singer   
Must then pass out of sight, not even relieved   
Of the evil burthen of the words. Stellification   
Is for the few, and comes about much later   
When all record of these people and their lives   
Has disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm.   
A few are still interested in them. “But what about   
So-and-so?” is still asked on occasion. But they lie   
Frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorus
Speaks of a totally different incident with a similar name   
In whose tale are hidden syllables


Of what happened so long before that
In some small town, one indifferent summer.",Mythology and Folklore
Five Poems From “Helen: A Revision”,"Nothing is known about Helen but her voice
Strange glittering sparks
Lighting no fires but what is reechoed
Rechorded, set on the icy sea.

All history is one, as all the North Pole is one
Magnetic, music to play with, ice
That has had to do with vision
And each one of us, naked.
Partners. Naked.

Helen: A Revision
ZEUS: It is to be assumed that I do not exist while most people in the vision assume that I do exist. This is to be one of the extents of meaning between the players and the audience. I have to talk like this because I am the lord of both kinds of sky—and I don't mean your sky and their sky because they are signs, I mean the bright sky and the burning sky. I have no intention of showing you my limits. The players in this poem are players. They have taken their parts not to deceive you [or me for that matter] but because they have been paid in love or coin to be players. I have known for a long time that there is not a fourth wall in a play. I am called Zeus and I know this.

THERSITES: [Running out on the construction of the stage.] The fourth wall is not as important as you think it is.

ZEUS: [Disturbed but carrying it off like a good Master of Ceremonial.] Thersites is involuntary. [He puts his arm around him.] I could not play a part if I were not a player.

THERSITES: Reveal yourself to me and don't pretend that there are people watching you. I am alone on the stage with you. Tell me the plot of the play.

ZEUS: [Standing away.] Don't try to talk if you don't have to. You must admit there is no audience. Everything is done for you.

THERSITES: Stop repeating yourself. You old motherfucker. Your skies are bad enough. [He looks to the ground.] A parody is better than a pun.

ZEUS: I do not understand your language.

Odysseus Hears of the Death of Kalypso,"All their songs are of one hour
Before dawn, when the birds begin.
I sing another.
In helpless midday, at the hour
Even sparrows have no heart to shrill
Comes news . . . Suddenly, the unimaginable
Needs imagination and finds none.

Violet ocean only nothing.
Smoke of thyme and of cedar,
Ornate birds, nothing.
Even a god who came here,
Hearing a sweet voice,
Would find only old fires now,
Brittle in the blackened trees.

She was mast and sail. She was
A stillness pregnant with motion,
Adorable to me as, all my life,
I have hidden a cruel, secret ocean
In sinews and in sleep and cowardice.
She forgave me. Once, she wept for me.
Our child died then, and she is with him.",Mythology and Folklore
Kalamazoo,"Once, in the city of Kalamazoo,   
The gods went walking, two and two,   
With the friendly phoenix, the stars of Orion,   
The speaking pony and singing lion.   
For in Kalamazoo in a cottage apart   
Lived the girl with the innocent heart.

Thenceforth the city of Kalamazoo   
Was the envied, intimate chum of the sun.   
He rose from a cave by the principal street.   
The lions sang, the dawn-horns blew,   
And the ponies danced on silver feet.   
He hurled his clouds of love around;   
Deathless colors of his old heart
Draped the houses and dyed the ground.   
O shrine of the wide young Yankee land,   
Incense city of Kalamazoo,   
That held, in the midnight, the priceless sun   
As a jeweller holds an opal in hand!

From the awkward city of Oshkosh came
Love the bully no whip shall tame,
Bringing his gang of sinners bold.
And I was the least of his Oshkosh men;
But none were reticent, none were old.
And we joined the singing phoenix then,
And shook the lilies of Kalamazoo   
All for one hidden butterfly.   
Bulls of glory, in cars of war   
We charged the boulevards, proud to die   
For her ribbon sailing there on high.   
Our blood set gutters all aflame,   
Where the sun slept without any heat—
Cold rock till he must rise again.   
She made great poets of wolf-eyed men—
The dear queen-bee of Kalamazoo,   
With her crystal wings, and her honey heart.   
We fought for her favors a year and a day   
(Oh, the bones of the dead, the Oshkosh dead,   
That were scattered along her pathway red!)   
And then, in her harum-scarum way,   
She left with a passing traveller-man—
With a singing Irishman   
Went to Japan.

Why do the lean hyenas glare
Where the glory of Artemis had begun—
Of Atalanta, Joan of Arc,
Cinderella, Becky Thatcher,
And Orphant Annie, all in one?
Who burned this city of Kalamazoo
Till nothing was left but a ribbon or two—
One scorched phoenix that mourned in the dew,
Acres of ashes, a junk-man's cart,
A torn-up letter, a dancing shoe,
(And the bones of the dead, the dead)?
Who burned this city of Kalamazoo—
Love-town, Troy-town Kalamazoo?

A harum-scarum innocent heart.",Mythology and Folklore
"Cold Calls (War Music, Continued)","Many believe in the stars.   


   Take Quinamid   
The son of a Dardanian astrologer   
Who disregarded what his father said   
And came to Troy in a taxi.   

Gone.   



    Odysseus to Greece:   

    “Hector has never fought this far from Troy.   
We want him further out. Beyond King Ilus’ tower.   
So walk him to the centre of the plain and, having killed him,   
Massacre the Trojans there.”   

“Ave!”   



    Immediately beyond the ridge is Primrose Hill   
Where Paris favoured Aphrodité.   

“Take it,” said Hector.   

    Greece shouted: “Hurry up!”   
Troy shouted: “Wait for us!”   



    See,   
Far off,   
Masts behind the half-built palisade.   
    Then   
Nearer to yourselves   
Scamánder’s ford   
From which the land ascends   
Then merges with the centre of the plain—   
The tower (a ruin) its highest point.   



    Heaven.   
Bad music.   
Queen Hera is examining her gums.   
Looking in through a window   
Teenaged Athena says:   
“Trouble for Greece.”   

      They leave.   



      Sea.   
      Sky.   
      The sunlit snow.   

      Two armies on the plain.   
Hector, driven by Lutie,   
His godchild and his nephew,   
Going from lord to Trojan lord:   

“The ships by dark.”   



    The ruined tower.   

      In front of it—   
Their banners rising one by one.   
One after one, and then another one—   
50,000 Greeks.   

      And on a rise in front of Greece   
Two hero lords:   

      Ajax the Great of Salamis   
Behind his shield—   
                        
            As fifty Trojan shields   
Topped with blue plumes, swivelling their points,   
Come up the rise—   
      Lord Teucer (five feet high and five feet wide)   
Loading his bow,   
Peering round Ajax’ shield,   
Dropping this Trojan plume or that,   
Ordering his archers to lie flat,   
Promising God as many sheep as there are sheep to count   
If he can put a shaft through Hector’s neck.   

      Prosperity!   
Beneath the blue, between the sea, the snow, there   
    Hector is   
Surrendering the urn of one he has just killed   
To one who thought that he had killed the same.   
      Lord Teucer’s eye/Prince Hector’s throat.
But God would not. The bowstring snaps.   



      Outside God’s inner court.   
Queen Hera and Athena still in line.   
Hera so angry she can hardly speak.   
      A voice:   
“The Wife, the Daughter.”   
“You go. His face will make me   
    heave.”   



“Serene and Dignified Grandee.”   
“Papa to you.”   

“Papa”—His hand—   
“I know you do not want the Holy Family   
    visiting the plain.   
But some of us would like to help the Greeks.   
They lost their champion she.   
    Thousands of them have died. Now they are in retreat.   
    Please look.”
      
      The plain.   

“You will come back the moment that I call?”   
“Of course, Papa.”   
“Then . . . yes. Encourage Greece.   
But voices only.   
    Words. Shouts. That sort of thing. A move—and home you come.”   
“Of course, Papa.”   

      The plain.   

      Lord Teucer’s archers hidden in its grass.   

    Chylábborak, Lord Hector’s brother-in-law, to his blue plumes:
“Move!”   
“Move!”   
      And on their flanks, between the sea and snow,   
Led by Teléspiax’ silver yard   
All Ilium’s masks   

“Down came their points. Out came their battle cry.   
And our cool Mr 5 x 5 called: ‘Up.’ And up we got   
And sent our arrows into them,   
That made them pirouette,   
Topple back down the rise, leaving their dead   
For some of us to strip, and some, the most,   
To pause, to point, to plant, a third, a fourth   
Volley into their naked backs. Pure joy!”   



      Chylábborak,   
Holding his ground:   
“Centre on me.   
More die in broken than in standing ranks.   
Apollo! Aphrodité! Our gods are here!   
You taste the air, you taste their breath!   
The Greek fleet, ours, by dark!”   

      Then he is ringed.   

      See an imperial pig harassed by dogs.   
      How, like a masterchef his crêpes,   
      He tosses them; and on their way back down   
      Eviscerates, then flips them back into the pack.   
Likewise Chylábborak the Greeks who rushed.   

      Hector has seen it. As—   
Beneath the blue, the miles of empty air,   
Him just one glitter in that glittering   mass—   
The hosts begin to merge.   



      Fine dust clouds mixed with beams of light.   
The Prince, down from his plate.   
Either sides’ arrows whingeing by:   
“Cover my back.”   
Finding a gap   
Dismissing blows as gales do slates,   
Then at a run, leaping into the ring,   
Taking Chylábborak’s hand:   
“If you don’t mind?”   



      Agamemnon:   
“Our time has come. God keeps his word.   
Fight now as you have never fought.   
We will be at Troy’s gates by dusk,   
Through them by dark,   
By dawn, across our oars,   
As we begin our journey home,   
Watching the windmills on its Wall   
Turn their sails in flames.”   



    Heaven. The Wife. The Daughter.   

    Hands release black lacquer clasps inlaid with particles of gold.   
Silk sheaths—with crashing waves and fishscales woven on a   
            navy ground—   
Flow on the pavement.   

      Hands take their hands   

      While other hands supply   

      Warwear,   

      Their car,   

      And put the reins into Athena’s hands.   



“. . . Troy’s gates by dusk,   
      Through them by dark . . .”   



      The Hours, the undeniable,   
Open the gates of Paradise.   

      Beyond   

      The wastes of space.   

      Before   

      The blue.   

      Below   

      Now near   

      The sea, the snow.   



      All time experts in hand-to-hand action—   
Friecourt, Okinawa, Stalingrad West—   
Could not believe the battle would gain.   
But it did.   

      Chylábborak’s ring is ringed. And then no ring at all.   
Some Trojans raise their hands in prayer;   
      Some Panachéans shout for joy and wait to drag the corpses off.


      Lutie, alone, the reins in one, his other hand   
Hacking away the hands that grab his chariot’s bodywork,   
Rearing his horses, Starlight and Bertie, through,   
      To,   
      Yes,   
      Chylábborak up; rescued;   
Prince Hector covering. Then:   

“Zoo-born wolf! Front for a family of thieves!”   
Lord Diomed, on foot, with Sethynos.   
      My Lutie answering:   
“Be proud Prince Hector is your Fate.”   
(Which will be so,   
Though Lutie will not see it.)   
      Chylábborak and Hector do not want to disappoint this oily pair:   
“Here come the Sisters Karamazof, Spark,”   
Chylábborak said. “Let’s send them home in halves.”   
And jumped back down.   



      Around the tower, 1000 Greeks, 1000 Ilians, amid their swirl,   
His green hair dressed in braids, each braid   
Tipped with a little silver bell, note   
Nyro of Simi—the handsomest of all the Greeks, save A.   
                  The trouble was, he had no fight. He dashed from fight to fight,
Struck a quick blow, then dashed straight out again.   
Save that this time he caught,   
As Prince Aenéas caught his breath,   
That Prince’s eye; who blocked his dash,   
And as Lord Panda waved and walked away,   
Took his head off his spine with a backhand slice—   
Beautiful stuff . . . straight from the blade . . .   
      Still, as it was a special head,   
Mowgag, Aenéas’ minder—   
Bright as a box of rocks, but musical—   
Spiked it, then hoisted it, and twizzling the pole   
Beneath the blue, the miles of empty air,   
Marched to the chingaling of its tinklers,   
A knees high majorette   
Towards the Greeks, the tower.   



      A roar of wind across the battlefield.   

      A pause.   

      And then   

      Scattering light,   
The plain turned crystal where their glidepath stopped,   
The Queen of Heaven shrills: “Typhoid for Troy!”   
And through poor Nyro’s wobbling mouth   
Athena yells:   

“Slew of assiduous mediocrities!   
Meek Greeks!”   



      It is enough.   

      Centre-plain wide,   
Lit everywhere by rays of glorious light,   
They rushed their standards into Ilium,   
      Diomed (for once) swept forward;   
Converting shame to exaltation with his cry:   

“Never—to Helen’s gold without her self!   
      Never—to Helen’s self   
    without her gold!”   

      Mowgag well slain.   
Hewn through his teeth, his jaw slashed off,   
And Nyro’s head beside him in the grass.   

      When Nyro’s mother heard of this   
She shaved her head; she tore her frock; she went outside   
Ripping her fingernails through her cheeks:   
Then down her neck; her chest; her breasts;   
And bleeding to her waist ran round the shops,   
Sobbing:   
“God, kill Troy.   
Console me with its death.   
Revenge is all I have.   
My boy was kind. He had his life to live.   
I will not have the chance to dance in Hector’s blood,   
But let me hear some have before I die.”   

“I saw her running round.   
      I took the photograph.   
      It summed the situation up.   
      He was her son.   
      They put it out in colour. Right?   
      My picture went around the   
    world.”   



      Down the shaft of the shot in his short-staved bow   
      Lord Panda has been follow-spotting Diomed.   

      Between “her self ” / “her gold” he shoots.   
It hits. And as its barbs protrude through Dio’s back   
Aenéas hears Lord Panda shout:   
“He bleeds! The totem Greek! Right-shoulder-front!
How wise of Artemis to make   
Panda her matador! Her numero uno! Moi!”   

      Diomed hit,   
The heart went out of those who followed him   
And they fell back.   



    Shields all round   

Diomed on his knees   

Lifting his hands:   

“Sister and wife of God”   

As Sethynos breaks off the arrowhead   

“Eliminate my pain.”   

Settles his knee beneath his hero’s shoulderblades   

“Let me kill that oaf who claims my death”   

Bridges his nape with one hand   

“Before it comes with honour to my name.”   

    Then with his other hand   
In one long strong slow pull   
Drew the shank back, and out.   



    She heard his prayer.   

    Before their breathless eyes   
His blood ran back into the pout the shank had left,   
And to complete her miracle   
Lord Diomed rose up between them, stood in the air,   
Then hovered down onto his toes   
Brimming with homicidal joy,   
Imparting it to Greece.   

    Then Troy was driven back,   
Trampling the half-stripped still-masked carcasses   
Hatching the centre of the plain.   



      Aenéas / Panda.   
      

“Get him.”   

“Get him! I got him. He is dead. But there he is.”   

      And Diomed has spotted them.   

“Calm down,” Aenéas said. “Perhaps he is possessed.”   

“What god would visit him?”   

“So pray to yours—and try another shot.”   

“Huntress,” Lord Panda prays,   
      Bright-ankled   god of nets and lines,
      Of tangled mountains, ilex groves and dark cascades . . .”   

      But Artemis was bored with him   
And let him rise, still praying hard,   
Into the downflight of the javelin   
Diomed aired at Prince Aenéas.   

    Sunlit, it went through Panda’s lips, out through his neck, and then
Through Biblock’s neck.   
      And so they fell; the lord, face up; the friend, face down   
Gripping the blood-smeared barb between his teeth,   
Between the sea and snow.   

      Aenéas covers them.   

      Eyeing his plate   
—Technology you can enjoy—   
Diomed found, and threw, a stone   
As heavy as a cabbage made of lead,   
That hit, and split, Aenéas’ hip.   
Who went down on one knee   
And put his shield hand on the grass   
And with his other hand covered his eyes.   
Dido might have become a grandmother   
And Rome not had its day, except   
As Diomed came on to lop his top   
Aenéas’ mama, Aphrodité (dressed   
In grey silk lounge pyjamas piped with gold   
And snake-skin flip-flops) stepped   
Between him and the Greek.   
A glow came from her throat, and from her hair   
A fragrance that betokened the divine.   
Stooping, she kissed him better, as   
Queen Hera whispered: “Greek, cut that bitch.”   
And, Diomed, you did; nicking Love’s wrist.   



    Studying the ichor as   
It seeped across her pulse into her palm   
Our Lady of the Thong lifted her other hand   
Removed a baby cobra from her hair   
And dropped it, Diomed, onto your neck,   
And saw its bite release its bane into your blood.   
      Then nobody could say   
Who Diomed fought for, or for what he fought.   

      Rapt through the mass   
      Now shouting at the sky, now stomping on the plain,   
      He killed and killed and killed, Greek, Trojan, Greek,
Lord/less, shame/fame, both gone; and gone   
Loyalty nurtured in the face of death,   
The duty of revenge, the right to kill,   
To jeer, to strip, to gloat, to be the first   
To rally but the last to run, all gone—   
And gone, our Lady Aphrodité, giggling.   

      While everywhere,   

Driving your fellow Greeks   
    Back down the long incline that leads to the Scamánder’s ford,
Surely as when   
Lit from the dark part of the sky by sudden beams,   
A bitter wind   
Detonates line by line of waves against the shore.   

    No mind. Even as Teucer backed away   
He kept his eyes on you.   
“You feel the stress? You feel the fear?   
Behold your enemy! the Prince God loves!”   
    See   Teucer’s bow. Hear Teucer’s: “This time lucky.”   
    His—   
But this time it was not our Father, God,   
Who saved your life, my Prince.   
    As Agamemnon cried:   
“The ships are safe.   
Stand at the riverside’s far bank.”   
Teléspiax heard the rustle of Lord Teucer’s shot   
And stood between yourself and it.   

    His head was opened, egglike, at the back,   
Mucked with thick blood, blood trickling from his mouth.   
His last words were:   
“Prince, your trumpeter has lost his breath.”   

    “Our worst fear was his face would fade,”   
    Teléspiax’s father said.
“But it did not. We will remember it until we die.”   

    “Give his instrument to Hogem,” Hector said, and went—   
Lutie on reins—between the sea and snow,   
Throwing his chariots wide, Scamánderwards,   
As easily as others might a cloak.   



    Diomed among this traffic, on his own,   
Among his dead,   
Their pools of blood, their cut-off body-parts,   
Their cut-off heads,   
Ashamed as his head cleared   
To see Odysseus, Idomeneo, the Ajax—Big and Small—   
Whipping away downslope, shouting towards Odysseus:   
“Where are you going with your back to the battle?”   
Who shouted back, although he did not turn:   
“Look left!”   
And there was Lutie driving Hector onto him,   

Sure they would trample him, for sure   
Queen Hera’s human, Diomed,   
Would stand and die, except:   
“Arms up, young king—” Nestor, full tilt,   
Reins round his tummy, leaning out “—and   
Jump . . .” wrists locked “. . . You young are just . . .”   
Swinging him up onto the plate “. . . too much.”   

“With your permission, Da?”   
Nod. Drew. Then threw the chariot’s javelin   
As Lutie spun his wheels, and Hector threw—   
Those skewers trading brilliance as they passed—   
And missed—both vehicles slither-straightening,   
Regaining speed, close, close, then driven apart   
By empty cars careering off the incline,   
Or stationary cars, their horses cropping grass.   

“Daddy, go slow. Hector will say I   ran.”   
“But not the widows you have made.”   

    And slow   
    And low   
Cruising the blue above this mix   
Heaven’s Queen and Ringsight-eyed Athena   
Trumpeting down huge worms of sound   
As Hector’s car rereached king Nestor’s,   and:   
“What kept you, Prince?” Diomed offered as they came abreast:   
“You went for a refreshing towel?”   
And threw his axe, that toppled through the air, and, oh,   
Hector, my Hector, as you thought:   
“If Heaven helps me Heaven shows it loves the best,”   
Parted your Lutie’s mesh and smashed into his heart.   

    What did you say as God called you to death   
Dear Lutie?   

“King Prince, I leave you   driverless.”   

    And put the reins into his hands, and fled   
Into oblivion   

      As Hector with his other hand   
Held what his Lutie was, upright, face forwards, in between   
The chariot’s basket and himself,   
Shouting as he drove after them:   

“Loathsome Greek,   
Your loathsome hair, your loathsome blood,   
Your loathsome breath, your loathsome heart,   
Jump in your loathsome ships,   
I will come after you,   
Come over the Aegean after you,   
And find you though you hide inside   
Your loathsome father’s grave   
And with my bare hands twist your loathsome head   
Off your loathsome neck.”   

      There was a Greek called Themion.   
Mad about armour. If not armour, cars.   
Of course he went to Troy. And Troy   
Saw a stray spear transfix him as he drove.   
      Companionably, his horses galloped up   
On Starlight’s side, and muddled Starlight down,   
And Bertie down, and brought the Prince   
(Still holding Lutie) down, as all the world   
Hurried, as if by windheads, on towards   Scamánder’s ford.   


hether you reach it from the palisade   
Or through the trees that dot the incline’s last stretch
You hear Scamánder’s voice before you see   
What one may talk across on quiet days   
Its rippling sunspangled breadth   
Streaming across the bars of pebbly sand   
That form its ford   
—Though on the Fleet’s side deeper, darkly bright.   

      And here   
Tiptoeing from this bar to that,   
Settling the cloudy sunshine of her hair,   
Her towel retained by nothing save herself,   
The god of Tops and Thongs   
Our Lady Aphrodité came,   
Her eyes brimfull with tears.   



    Scamánder is astonished by his luck.   

“Beauty of Beauties, why are you weeping?”   
“I have been hurt, Scamánder.”   
“No . . .”   
“Humiliated.”   
“No . . .”   
“Me. A god. Just like yourself. Touched . .   .”   
“Touched!”   
“By a man.”   
“A man!”   
“A Greek.”   
“Death to all Greeks!”   
“He cut me!”   
“Sacrilege!   
. . . But where?”   
“I need your healing touch.”   
“How can I help you if you do not show me where?”   
“Moisten its lips and my wound will be healed.”   
“You must say where!”   
“Well . . .”   
    The towel has slipped an inch.   
“I am afraid you will be disappointed.”   
“Never.”   
“Are you sure?”   
“Yes!”   
“You will not criticize me?”   
“No!”   
    Her wrist upturned.   
    Out-turned.   
    Her opened palm.   
    Fanning the fingers of her other hand,   
Stroking his spangles with her fingertips.   
“Goddess, I love you.   
I have always loved you.   
Say that you love me. Even a little.   
I beg you. God grant it.”   
“I need your help, Scamánder.”   
“Take pity on me. Come into me.”   
“You have your nymphs.”   
“Bores! Bores!”   
“I might be nibbled by an eel!”   
“Death to all eels!”   
    The towel is down.   
“Step into me . . .   
I love your toes . . . please let me kiss your toes . . .   
Your little dinkum-inkum toes . . .”   
“No one has kissed them so nicely, Scamánder.”   
“And now your knees . . .”   
“You tickle me . . .”   
“And now your thighs!”   
“Oh, oh, go on . . .”   
“And now your bum!   
    Your Holy Bum! Your Sacred Bum!   
    The Bum of Paradise!”   
“Oh, my Scamánder, I must have your help . . .”   
“Anything!”   
    The towel goes curling off,   
And as she floated on his stream   
Our Lady Aphrodité said:   
“At any moment now the Greeks will reach your   
         Troy-side bank . . .”   

    Recall those sequences   
    When horsemen ride out of the trees and down into a   stream   
Somewhere in Kansas or Missouri, say.   
    So—save they were   thousands—Greece   
Into Scamánder’s ford.   



    Coming downstream,   
A smallish wave   

    That passes   

    But   

    Scamánder’s flow does not relapse.   

    Indeed   

    Almost without a sound   
Its murmuring radiance rose   
Into a dark, torrential surge,   
Clouded with boulders, crammed with trees, as clamorous   
         as if it were a sea,   
That lifted Greece, then pulled Greece down,   
Cars gone, masks gone, gone under, reappearing, gone:   

“Onto your knees! Praise Hector for this flood!   
The Prince God loves!” Prince Hector claims   
As he comes through the trees.   

    They do.   
Then up and run, run, thousands of them,   
To hold those Greeks who got back out   
Under until their bubbles stopped; while those swept off   
Turned somersaults amid Scamánder’s undertow.   



    The flat—   

    1000 yards of it between the river and the palisade.   

    The King:   

“The Lord has not abandoned us.   
To cross will be as bad for them.”   



    But it was not to be as bad for them.   

    Indeed,   
As Hector drove towards Scamánder’s brink,   
And as—their banners rising one by one,   
One after one and then another one—   
He and all Ilium began to enter it,   
    The river reassumed its softly-spoken, smooth, sunspangled way.   

    And Agamemnon cried:   

“God, what are You for?   
What use are You to me?”   

    As Hector cries:   

“Two miracles!   
Your Prince is close to God!”   

    And Hera to Athena:   

“Fog?”   

    And fog came down.   

    And most of Greece got out.   



    Troy holding hands midstream.   
An army peering through its masks.   



    Miss Tops and Thongs to God:   

“Your Hera has . . .”   

    And with a wish He turned the fog to light   

    And with a word He called them back to Heaven.   



    Sky.   
    Snow.   
    The 1000 yards.   
    The palisade.   

    Hector:   
“I am your Prince.   
My name means He-Who-Holds.   
Troy. And the plain. And now the ships.   
    For Troy!” his battle cry,   
Rising into a common cry, that cry   
Into a clamour, and that clamour to   
Bayings of hatred.   

    800 yards.   

    The Child:   
“We are the Greeks. We fight to win. If one is lost,   
Close his eyes, step over him, and kill his enemy.”   

    800 yards.   

    The Greeks are tiring.   
    Nestor is on his knees:   

“God of all Gods, Most Holy and Most High,
      If Greece has ever sacrificed fresh blood to you,
      Protect our ships.”   



    Heaven.   
Soft music. Summertime. Queen Hera and Athena? Yes . . .   

    Some lesser gods   
Observing their approach, approach,   
Salaam, and then   
Lead them—   
Now both in black wraparound tops—   
To God:   

“Darling Daddy, here we are.”   
“And” (Hera) “here we stay   
Until you stop that worthless Hector killing Greeks.”   
    Up steps Love.   
    Hera: “Why is she wearing a tent?”   
    Love: “Father, see this.” (Her wrist.)   
“Human strikes god! Communism! The end of everything!”   

“Darlings,” He said,   
“You know that being a god means being blamed.   
Do this—no good. Do that—the same. The answer is:   
Avoid humanity.   
    Remember—I am God.   
I see the bigger picture.”   

“And I am Hera, Heaven’s Queen,   
Greece worships me.”   

“Stuff Greece,” Love said.   
“Your blubber-bummed wife with her gobstopper nipples   
Hates Troy because Troy’s Paris put her last   
When we stripped off for him.   
    As for the Ithacan boat-boy’s undercurved preceptatrix,   
She hates Troy because my statue stands on its acropolis.”   

      Hera: “The cities’ whores were taxed to pay for it.”   
      Love (Dropping onto her knees before Himself):   
“Please . . . stop them harming Troy. The greatest city   
                in the world.”   

      While Hera and Athena sang:   

“Cleavage! Cleavage!   
      Queen of the Foaming Hole.   
      Mammoth or man or midge   
      She sucks from pole to pole.”   

      And God has had enough of it.   

      Lifting His scales He said:   

“Hector will have his day of victory.”   
Then crashed them to the ground.   



      700 yards.   

      The palisade.   

      Its gate.   

      Late sunlight on gilt beaks.   

“There’s no escape from Troy.”   
“Or from the plain at Troy.”   

      Begging for ransom, Trojan Hoti,   
His arms around King Menelaos’ knees.   

      King Agamemnon: “Off.”   

      Then he punched Hoti in the face.   
Then punched him in the face again.   
And then again. And when he fell   
King Agamemnon kicked him in the groin.   
Kicking him in the groin with so much force   
It took a step to follow up each kick.   
Then pulled him up,   
Then dragged him by his hair   
This way and that,   
Then left him, calling:   
“Finish him off.”   
And someone did.   



“I was sixteen. I said: ‘Where is Achilles?’   
Hard as it is to share another’s troubles when your own are pressing   
Great Ajax took my hands in his and said:   
‘He loves us. He is with us. He will come.’”   

      But he did not.   

      Then Ajax to himself:   
“Dear Lord, you made me straight.   
Give me the strength to last till dark.”   

      The Prince: “I get past   everything I see.   
Their war is lost.”   

      It was.   

      Aenéas, Ábassee, Sarpédon, Gray,   
Calling to one another down the line.   
      Then, with a mighty wall of sound,   
As if a slope of stones   
Rolled down into a lake of broken glass   
We ran at them.   



    And now the light of evening has begun   
To shawl across the plain:   
Blue gray, gold gray, blue gold,   
Translucent nothingnesses   
Readying our space,   
Within the deep, unchanging sea of space,   
For Hesper’s entrance, and the silver wrap.   

    Covered with blood, mostly their own,   
Loyal to death, reckoning to die   
Odysseus, Ajax, Diomed,   
Idomeneo, Nestor, Menelaos   
And the King:   

“Do not die because others have died.”   
“Do not show them the palms of your hands.”   

“Achil!”   
“Achil!”   
“If he won’t help us, Heaven help us.”   

“Stand still and fight.”   
“Feel shame in one another’s eyes.”   
“I curse you, God. You are a liar, God.   
Troy will be yours by dark—immortal lies.”   
“Home!”   
“Home!”   
“There’s no such place.”   
“You can’t launch burning ships.”   
“More men survive if no one runs.”   

    But that is what Greece did.   

    Dropping their wounded,   
Throwing down their dead,   
Their shields, their spears, their swords,   
They ran.   

    Leaving their heroes tattered, filthy, torn   

    And ran   

    And ran   

    Above their cries:   

“I am the Prince! The victory is mine!”   

    Chylábborak:   

“Do not take cowardice for granted.”   

    Scarce had he said it, when   
His son, Kykéon, standing next to him   
Took Ajax’ final spear cast in his chest.   

“I shall not wear your armour, Sir,” he said.   
And died.   

“My son is dead.”   

    The Prince:   

“Hector is loved by God.”   

    And Greece, a wall of walking swords,   
But walking backwards,   
Leaving the plain in silence   
And in tears.   



    Idomeneo,   
Running back out at those Trojans who came too close:   
      

“You know my name. Come look for me. And boy,   
The day you do will be the day you die.”   



    Hector to Troy:   
“Soldiers!—   
Unmatched my force, unconquerable my will.   
After ten years of days, in one long day   
To be remembered for as many days   
As there are days to come, this is my day,   
Your Hector’s day. Troy given back to Troy.   
My day of victory!”   
      And when the cheering died:   
“Some say: destroy Greece now. But I say no.   
Out of your cars. Eat by your fires.   
Two hundred fires! Around each fire   
Five hundred men!   
“The sound of grindstones turning through the night,   
The firelight that stands between our blades,   
So let King Agamemnon’s Own hold hands   
And look into each other’s frightened eyes.   
“True God! Great Master of the Widespread Sky!   
If only you would turn   
Me into a god,   
As you, through me,   
Tomorrow by their ships   
Will see Greece die.”   



    Silence.   



    A ring of lights.   

    Within   

    Immaculate   

    In boat-cloaks lined with red   

    King Agamemnon’s lords—   

    The depression of retreat.   
The depression of returning to camp.   
Him at the centre of their circle   
Sobbing,   
Then shouting:   

“We must run for it!”   

    Dark glasses in parked cars.   



“King Agamemnon of Mycenae,   
God called, God raised, God recognized,   
You are a piece of shit,” Diomed said.   

    Silence again.   

“Let us praise God,” Lord Ajax said,   
“That Hector stopped before he reached the ships.”   

    Silence again.   

    Then   

    Nestor   
(Putting his knee back in):   

“Paramount Agamemnon, King of Kings,   
Lord of the Shore, the Islands and the Sea   
I shall begin, and end, with you.   
    Greece needs good words. Like them or not, the credit   
            will be yours.   
Determined. Keen to fight, that is our Diomed—   
As I should know. When just a boy of ten I fought   
Blowback of Missolonghi, a cannibal, drank blood,   
He captured you, he buggered you, you never walked again.   
But Diomed lacks experience.   
    God has saved us, momentarily.   
God loves Achilles.   
You took, and you have kept, Achilles’ ribband she.”   

“I was a fool!”   

“And now you must appease him, Agamemnon.   
Humble words. Hands shaken. Gifts.”   

    The King—wiping his eyes:   

“As usual,   
Pylos has said the only things worth hearing.   
I was mad to take the she.   
I shall pay fitting damages.   
Plus her, I offer him   
The Corfiot armour that my father wore.”   

    Silence.   

    The sea.   

    Its whispering.   

“To which I add: a set of shields.   
Posy, standard, ceremonial.   
The last, cut from the hide of a one ton Lesbian bull.”   

    Silence.   

    The sea.   

“And . . . a chariot!   
From my own équipe!   
They smoke along the ground . . .   
They ride its undulations like a breeze . . .”   

    The sea.   

“Plus: six horses—saddled, bridled and caparisoned,   
Their grooms and veterinarians . . .   

    . . . And six tall shes:   
Two good dancers, two good stitchers, two good cooks.   
All capable of bearing boys . . .   

“Oh, very well then: twenty loaves of gold,   
The same of silver, and the same of iron.”   

    Masks. Lights.   
Behind the lords   
Some hundreds from the army have walked up.   
    Lord Nestor smiles.   
Lord Menelaos smiles.   

“Plus—   
Though it may well reduce your King to destitution:   
    A’kimi’kúriex,   
My summer palace by the Argive sea,   
Its lawns, its terraces, its curtains in whose depths   
Larks dive above a field of waving lilies   
And fishscale-breakers shatter on blue rocks.   
Then, as he draws their silky heights aside,   
Standing among huge chests of looted booty,   
Long necked, with lowered lids, but candid eyes,   
My living daughter, Íphaniss, a diamond   
Big as a cheeseball for her belly stud.   
His wife to be! minus—I need not say—her otherwise huge   
          bride-price.”   

“More!”   
“More!”   
“More!”   

    Lord Ajax almost has to hold him up.   

“The whole of eastern Pel’po’nesia—   
An area of outstanding natural beauty—   
Its cities, Epi’dávros, Trów’é’zen,   
Their fortresses, their harbours and their fleets,   
Their taxpayers—glad to accept his modest ways—   
All this, the greatest benefaction ever known,   
If he agrees to fight. And he admits I am his King.”   

    Instantly, Nestor:   

“An offer God himself could not refuse.   
All that remains to say is:   
Who shall take it to Achilles?”   

    Agamemnon: “You will.”   



    Starlight.   

    The starlight on the sea.   



    The sea.   

    Its whispering   

    Mixed with the prayers   
Of Ajax and of Nestor as they walk   
Along the shore towards Achilles’ gate.   



“My lords?”   

“Your lord.”   

“This way.”   



    They find him, with guitar,   
Singing of Gilgamesh.   

“Take my hands. Here they are.”   

    You cannot take your eyes away from him.   
His own so bright they slow you down.   
His voice so low, and yet so clear.   
You know that he is dangerous.   



“Patroclus?   
Friends in need.   
    Still,   
Friends.   
    That has not changed,   
I think.   
    Autómedon? Wine.   



“Dear Lord and Master of the Widespread Sky,
      Accept ourselves, accept our prayers.”   



    Their cups are taken.   

“Father friend?”   

    King Nestor (for his life):   

“You know why we are here.   
    We face death.   
The mass choose slavery.   
Mycenae has admitted he was wrong to wrong yourself.   
In recompense he offers you   
The greatest benefaction ever known.   
Take it, and fight. Or else Hector will burn the ships   
Then kill us randomly.   
    Remember what your Father said   
The day when Ajax and myself drove up to ask   
If you could come with us to Troy?   
That you should stand among the blades where honour grows.   
And secondly, to let your anger go.   
    Spirit, and strength, and beauty have combined   
Such awesome power in you   
A vacant Heaven would offer you its throne.   
Think of what those who will come after us will say.   
    Save us from Hector’s god, from Hector, and from Hector’s force.   
I go down on my knees to you, Achilles.”   

“I must admire your courage, father friend,   
For treating me as if I was a fool.   
I shall deal with Hector as I want to.   
You and your fellow countrymen will die   
For how your King has treated me.   

    I have spent five years fighting for your King.   
My record is: ten coastal and ten inland cities   
Burnt to the ground. Their males, massacred.   
Their cattle, and their women, given to him.   
Among the rest, Briseis the Beautiful, my ribband she.   
Not that I got her courtesy of him.   
She joined my stock in recognition of   
My strength, my courage, my superiority,   
Courtesy of yourselves, my lords.   
    I will not fight for him.   
He aims to personalise my loss.   
Briseis taken from Achilles—standard practice:   
Helen from Menelaos—war.   
    Lord Busy Busy, building his palisade, mounting my she,   
One that I might have picked to run my house,   
Raising her to the status of a wife.   
    Do I hate him? Yes, I hate him. Hate him.   
And should he be afraid of me? He should.   
I want to harm him. I want him to feel pain.   
In his body, and between his ears.   
    I must admit,   
Some of the things that you have said are true.   
But look what he has done to me! To me!   
The king on whom his kingliness depends!   
I will not fight for him.   
    Hearing your steps, I thought: at last,   
My friends have come to visit me.   
They took their time about it, true—   
After he took my she none of you came—   
Now, though—admittedly they are in trouble,   
Serious trouble—they have arrived as friends,   
And of their own accord.   
    But you have not come here as friends.   
And you have not come of your own accord.   
You came because your King told you to come.   
You came because I am his last resort.   
And, incidentally, your last resort.   

    At least he offers stuff.   
All you have offered is advice:   
‘Keep your temper . . .   
    Mind your tongue . . .   
    Think what the world will say . . .’   
No mention of your King’s treatment of me.   
No sign of love for me behind your tears.   
    I will not fight for him.   
    I can remember very well indeed   
The day you two grand lords came visiting my father’s house,
How I ran out to you, and took your hands—   
The greatest men that I had ever seen:   
Ajax, my fighting cousin, strong, brave, unafraid to   die;   
Nestor, the King of Sandy Pylos, wisdom’s sword.   
And then, when all had had enough to eat and drink   
And it was sealed that I should come to Troy,   
Then my dear father said that lordship knows   
Not only how to fight, and when to hold its tongue,   
But of the difference between a child enraged   
And honour bound lords.   
    I will not fight for him.   
    There is a King to be maintained. You are his lords.   
My fighting powers prove my inferiority.   
Whatever he, through you, may grant,   
I must receive it as a favour, not of right,   
Go back to him with downcast looks, a suppliant tone,   
Acknowledge my transgressions—I did not   
Applaud his sticky fingers on my she’s meek flesh.   
    My mother says I have a choice:   
Live as a happy backwood king for aye   
Or give the world an everlasting murmur of my name,   
And die.   
    Be up tomorrow sharp   
To see me sacrifice to Lord Poseidon and set sail.   
    Oh, yes, his gifts:   
‘The greatest benefaction ever known.’   
    If he put Heaven in my hand I would not want it.   
His offers magnify himself.   
    Likewise his child.   
I do not want to trash the girl.   
She is like me. Bad luck to have poor friends.   
Bad luck to have his Kingship as your sire.   
    My father will select my wife.   
Each spring a dozen local kings drive up   
And lead their daughters naked round our yard.   
Some decent local girl. My father’s worth   
Is all the wealth we will require.   
    You Greeks will not take Troy.   
You have disintegrated as a fighting force.   
Troy is your cemetery. Blame your King.   
The man who you say has done all he can.   
The man who has admitted he was wrong.   
But he has not done all he can.   
And he has not admitted he was wrong.   
Or not to me.   
    I want him here, your King.   
His arms straight down his sides, his shoulders back,   
Announcing loud and clear that he was wrong to take my she.   
Apologising for that wrong, to me, the son of Péleus.   
Before my followers, with you, Pylos and Salamis,   
Crete. Sparta. Tyrins, Argos, Calydon, the Islands, here,   
Stood to attention on either side of him.   
      That is my offer. Take it, or die.   

    Nestor may stay the night.   
You, dear cousin Ajax, tell your King what I have said.   
Preferably, in front of everyone.”   
                     
                                    
                      Who said,   
As my Achilles lifted his guitar:   

“Lord, I was never so bethumped with words   
Since first I called my father Dad.”   



    The sea.   
Their feet along the sand to Agamemnon’s gate.   
And in starlit air   
The Trojans singing:   

“I love my wife, I love her dearly,   
      I love the hole she pisses through,   
      I love her lily-white tits   
      And her nut-brown arsehole,   
      I could eat her shit with a wooden spoon.”",Mythology and Folklore
Ondine,"At supper time an ondine’s narrow feet
made dark tracks on the hearth.
Like the heart of a yellow fruit was the fire’s heat,
but they rubbed together quite blue with the cold.
The sandy hem of her skirt dripped on the floor.
She sat there with a silvered cedar knot
for a low stool; and I sat opposite,
my lips and eyelids hot
in the heat of the fire. Piling on dry bark,
seeing that no steam went up from her dark dress,
I felt uneasiness
as though firm sand had shifted under my feet
in the wash of a wave.

I brought her soup from the stove and she would not eat,
but sat there crying her cold tears,
her blue lips quivering with cold and grief.
She blamed me for a thief,
saying that I had burned a piece of wood
the tide washed up. And I said, No,
the tide had washed it out again; and even so,
a piece of sodden wood was not so rare
as polished agate stones or ambergris.

She stood and wrung her hair
so that the water made a sudden splash
on the round rug by the door. I saw her go
across the little footbridge to the beach.
After, I threw the knot on the hot coals.
It fell apart and burned with a white flash,
a crackling roar in the chimney and dark smoke.
I beat it out with a poker
in the soft ash.

Now I am frightened on the shore at night,
and all the phosphorescent swells that rise
come towards me with the threat of her dark eyes
with a cold firelight in them;
and crooked driftwood writhes
in dry sand when I pass.

Should she return and bring her sisters with her,
the withdrawing tide
would leave a long pool in my bed.
There would be nothing more of me this side
the melting foamline of the latest wave.",Love
Postlude,"Now that I have cooled to you
Let there be gold of tarnished masonry,
Temples soothed by the sun to ruin   
That sleep utterly.
Give me hand for the dances,            
Ripples at Philae, in and out,         
And lips, my Lesbian,         
Wall flowers that once were flame.         

Your hair is my Carthage         
And my arms the bow,         
And our words arrows         
To shoot the stars         
Who from that misty sea         
Swarm to destroy us.         

But you there beside me—         
Oh how shall I defy you,         
Who wound me in the night         
With breasts shining         
Like Venus and like Mars?         
The night that is shouting Jason         
When the loud eaves rattle         
As with waves above me         
Blue at the prow of my desire.",Love
Syringa,"Orpheus liked the glad personal quality
Of the things beneath the sky. Of course, Eurydice was a part   
Of this. Then one day, everything changed. He rends   
Rocks into fissures with lament. Gullies, hummocks   
Can’t withstand it. The sky shudders from one horizon   
To the other, almost ready to give up wholeness.   
Then Apollo quietly told him: “Leave it all on earth.   
Your lute, what point? Why pick at a dull pavan few care to   
Follow, except a few birds of dusty feather,
Not vivid performances of the past.” But why not?   
All other things must change too.
The seasons are no longer what they once were,   
But it is the nature of things to be seen only once,
As they happen along, bumping into other things, getting along   
Somehow. That’s where Orpheus made his mistake.   
Of course Eurydice vanished into the shade;
She would have even if he hadn’t turned around.
No use standing there like a gray stone toga as the whole wheel   
Of recorded history flashes past, struck dumb, unable to utter an intelligent
Comment on the most thought-provoking element in its train.   
Only love stays on the brain, and something these people,   
These other ones, call life. Singing accurately
So that the notes mount straight up out of the well of   
Dim noon and rival the tiny, sparkling yellow flowers   
Growing around the brink of the quarry, encapsulates   
The different weights of the things.
                                                       But it isn’t enough   
To just go on singing. Orpheus realized this
And didn’t mind so much about his reward being in heaven   
After the Bacchantes had torn him apart, driven   
Half out of their minds by his music, what it was doing to them.
Some say it was for his treatment of Eurydice.
But probably the music had more to do with it, and   
The way music passes, emblematic
Of life and how you cannot isolate a note of it
And say it is good or bad. You must
Wait till it’s over. “The end crowns all,”
Meaning also that the “tableau”
Is wrong. For although memories, of a season, for example,   
Melt into a single snapshot, one cannot guard, treasure   
That stalled moment. It too is flowing, fleeting;   
It is a picture of flowing, scenery, though living, mortal,   
Over which an abstract action is laid out in blunt,   
Harsh strokes. And to ask more than this
Is to become the tossing reeds of that slow,
Powerful stream, the trailing grasses
Playfully tugged at, but to participate in the action   
No more than this. Then in the lowering gentian sky   
Electric twitches are faintly apparent first, then burst forth   
Into a shower of fixed, cream-colored flares. The horses   
Have each seen a share of the truth, though each thinks,   
“I’m a maverick. Nothing of this is happening to me,   
Though I can understand the language of birds, and   
The itinerary of the lights caught in the storm is fully apparent to me.
Their jousting ends in music much
As trees move more easily in the wind after a summer storm   
And is happening in lacy shadows of shore-trees, now, day after day.”

But how late to be regretting all this, even
Bearing in mind that regrets are always late, too late!   
To which Orpheus, a bluish cloud with white contours,   
Replies that these are of course not regrets at all,   
Merely a careful, scholarly setting down of
Unquestioned facts, a record of pebbles along the way.
And no matter how all this disappeared,   
Or got where it was going, it is no longer   
Material for a poem. Its subject
Matters too much, and not enough, standing there helplessly   
While the poem streaked by, its tail afire, a bad   
Comet screaming hate and disaster, but so turned inward   
That the meaning, good or other, can never   
Become known. The singer thinks
Constructively, builds up his chant in progressive stages   
Like a skyscraper, but at the last minute turns away.   
The song is engulfed in an instant in blackness   
Which must in turn flood the whole continent   
With blackness, for it cannot see. The singer   
Must then pass out of sight, not even relieved   
Of the evil burthen of the words. Stellification   
Is for the few, and comes about much later   
When all record of these people and their lives   
Has disappeared into libraries, onto microfilm.   
A few are still interested in them. “But what about   
So-and-so?” is still asked on occasion. But they lie   
Frozen and out of touch until an arbitrary chorus
Speaks of a totally different incident with a similar name   
In whose tale are hidden syllables


Of what happened so long before that
In some small town, one indifferent summer.",Love
Five Poems From “Helen: A Revision”,"Nothing is known about Helen but her voice
Strange glittering sparks
Lighting no fires but what is reechoed
Rechorded, set on the icy sea.

All history is one, as all the North Pole is one
Magnetic, music to play with, ice
That has had to do with vision
And each one of us, naked.
Partners. Naked.

Helen: A Revision
ZEUS: It is to be assumed that I do not exist while most people in the vision assume that I do exist. This is to be one of the extents of meaning between the players and the audience. I have to talk like this because I am the lord of both kinds of sky—and I don't mean your sky and their sky because they are signs, I mean the bright sky and the burning sky. I have no intention of showing you my limits. The players in this poem are players. They have taken their parts not to deceive you [or me for that matter] but because they have been paid in love or coin to be players. I have known for a long time that there is not a fourth wall in a play. I am called Zeus and I know this.

THERSITES: [Running out on the construction of the stage.] The fourth wall is not as important as you think it is.

ZEUS: [Disturbed but carrying it off like a good Master of Ceremonial.] Thersites is involuntary. [He puts his arm around him.] I could not play a part if I were not a player.

THERSITES: Reveal yourself to me and don't pretend that there are people watching you. I am alone on the stage with you. Tell me the plot of the play.

ZEUS: [Standing away.] Don't try to talk if you don't have to. You must admit there is no audience. Everything is done for you.

THERSITES: Stop repeating yourself. You old motherfucker. Your skies are bad enough. [He looks to the ground.] A parody is better than a pun.

ZEUS: I do not understand your language.

[They are silent together for a moment and then the curtain drops.]

And if he dies on this road throw wild blackberries at his ghost
And if he doesn't, and he won't, hope the cost
Hope the cost.

And the tenor of the what meets the why at the edge
Like a backwards image of each terror's lodge
Each terror's lodge.

And if he cries put his heart out with a lantern's goat
Where they say all passages to pay the debt
The lighted yet.

And in the skyey march of flesh
That boundary line where no body is
Preserve us, lord, from aches and harms
And bring my death.

And mud and fire
Preserve us, lord, from what would share a shroud
and bring my death.

The battlefield has harms. The trees have half
Their branches shot away. Preserve us, lord
From hair and mud and flesh.",Love

Odysseus Hears of the Death of Kalypso,"All their songs are of one hour
Before dawn, when the birds begin.
I sing another.
In helpless midday, at the hour
Even sparrows have no heart to shrill
Comes news . . . Suddenly, the unimaginable
Needs imagination and finds none.

Violet ocean only nothing.
Smoke of thyme and of cedar,
Ornate birds, nothing.
Even a god who came here,
Hearing a sweet voice,
Would find only old fires now,
Brittle in the blackened trees.

She was mast and sail. She was
A stillness pregnant with motion,
Adorable to me as, all my life,
I have hidden a cruel, secret ocean
In sinews and in sleep and cowardice.
She forgave me. Once, she wept for me.
Our child died then, and she is with him.",Love
